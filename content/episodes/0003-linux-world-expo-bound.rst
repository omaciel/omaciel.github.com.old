So here I am, counting the minutes until I get the hell out of work and
head down to Laguardia Airport where I’ll be boarding my plane to
Boston. My friend `Vinny <http://blog.supertoadman.com>`__ is picking me
up for what seems to be a great weekend of geekness. Tomorrow we’re
going to check out the exhibition floor at this year’s `Linux World
Expo <http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/live/12/events/12BOS05A>`__, Boston
Edition. I’m very excited about this for I will be there with my good
friend… Have you ever been to some type of event (it could be softball)
that you really enjoy but in the company of someone who doesn’t really
like it and only accompanied you after putting up with weeks of you
begging him/her to go with you? You know when someone in your team
scores a hat-trick and when you look for that someone to high five ,
he/she is almost falling asleep with boredom? Well, that is NOT going to
happen to me this time around, for Vinny and I dig almost the same
things. I’m definitely looking forward to checking out the new companies
and mingling with the Debian, Gentoo, and Gnome hackers. Hopefully
they’ll also have some freebies like they did back in the very first LWE
in NYC. Someone made me promise him I’d bring a Red Hat, err… hat back
with me. Also, now that I have an account with
`Flickr <http://www.flickr.com>`__, it will be easy to upload the
pictures I’m sure I’ll be taking as I walk through the booths. Friday
I’m having lunch with `Miguel de
Icaza <http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/activity-log.php>`__!!! Let me
say that again: **I’m having lunch with Miguel de Icaza!!!** Hahaha!!!
He was awsomely cool enough to accept my self-invitation to meet him and
get a tour of his office in Cambridge! It should be a very cool
experience! Saturday nothing planned… Most likely do some hacking with
`Mono <http://www.mono-project.com/about/index.html>`__ and do some
serious coffee drinking at the local Barnes and Nobble. Sunday up early
and drive to Microsoft’s HQ in Waltham for their day-long mini boot
camp. Finally, I fly back home Sunday evening where I’m sure I’ll be
greeted by my lovely wife and daughter!
