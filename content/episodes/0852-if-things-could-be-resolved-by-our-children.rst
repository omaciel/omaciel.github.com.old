Something interesting happened today. As my wife and I talked about the
economic bailout during dinner, we didn’t notice that Yv, my
soon-to-be-seven-year-old was paying close attention to what we were
saying. The following is a pretty close description of the dialogue that
followed:

-  **Yv**: … where are they getting US$700?
-  **Me**: They’re taking the mine from us and every other family.
-  **Yv**: Have they asked you if it is ok to do it?
-  **Me**: Not really…
-  **Yv**: But that’s **stealing**! Can they be **arrested**?

At which point I had no answer to give her…
