In order to celebrate the holidays and the success of the Brazilian
Ubuntu community, I have decided to sponsor the **Ubuntu Sweepstakes
2005**!!!

   `Launchpad <http://www.launchpad.net>`__ site and sign the code of
   conduct.

   your complete name and your actual Karma points. For those who
   already have an account at `Launchpad <http://www.launchpad.net>`__,
   send me your actual Karma points.
-  Just to clarify: Submit your actual Karma points at the date you
   submit your email! All entries will be checked religiously! ;)
-  Start translating the programs listed to be released together with
   Ubuntu Dapper Drake! Or, start submiting bug reports!!! The complete
   list can be seen

   team you cheer for! But do it quick!!! The sooner the better!
-  All participants and their respective Karma points will be published
   here for tracking purposes!
-  The sweepstake closes at December 25th at 12 noon (UTC)!
