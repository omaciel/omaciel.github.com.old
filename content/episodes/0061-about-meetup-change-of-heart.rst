Recently `MeetUp <http://www.meetup.com>`__, a then **free** group
organizing web service, has decided to charge registered groups for its
services. A Meetup meeting organizer must now pay $19 a month to use
their software. Having spent the last 8-9 months as the organizer for
the `Northern NJ Linux Meetup <http://linux.meetup.com/8/>`__ I’m
somewhat saddened by the fact that this move will most definitely mean
the end of the group. Averaging 3 members for ever meeting we’ve had so
far (with the exception of the day I brought someone from
`Ubuntu <http://www.ubuntulinux.org>`__ Linux to gives us a talk… that
day we had 7 members!), it just doesn’t make sense for me to fork out
the money. I’ve been toying with the idea of starting my own Linux User
Group but it seems to me that:

-  There aren’t enough Linux enthusiasts in Northern NJ;
-  People don’t feel the need to get together and “geek-out” once a
   month;

I have posted a final note on our board urging people to come out of the
Linux closet and make themselves heard. If by next week I don’t hear
anything I’m afraid I’ll have no choice but to resign. :-
