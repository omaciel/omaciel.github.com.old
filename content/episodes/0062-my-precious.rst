I have finally found my portable MP3 and OGG player to use on the go
with my Seagate 40GB disk (which I have nicknamed Pegasus):
`Billy <http://www.sheepfriends.com/?page=billy>`__! I downloaded the
setup file and chose my Pegasus as the destination folder. I then chose
one of the several music folders I have inside Pegasus and started
listening to my songs immediately. The program seems to have been
written for those of us who hate using the mouse and rather use keyboard
shortcuts. The system requirements are pretty low as well:

-  133MHz Pentium I or comparable
-  32MB RAM
-  1MB Hard Disk Space
-  16bit Sound Card
-  Windows 98
-  DirectX 3

There’s no stinking skin or fancy eye candy either. I think I can
finally remove `WinAmp <http://www.winamp.com>`__ from my computer at
work! =)
