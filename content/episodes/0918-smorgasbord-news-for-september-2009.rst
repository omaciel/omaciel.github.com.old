It’s been a while since I last wrote anything on my blog so here are
some interesting nuggets:

-  I’ve been **house hunting** for the last 3-4 months and I can
   honestly say that it is a very intense experience! There are so many
   things to learn and remember and so many different things to
   consider! Wouldn’t be nice if you knew right up front all the costs
   and fees involved in purchasing a house, the same way you know how
   much it costs to purchase a pair of sneakers (cost of sneakers plus
   sales tax)? Alas, the hard work has paid off and in about 3 weeks
   I’ll be a home owner for the first time!
-  Work has kept me very busy these last few months but thanks to some
   new goals and new hires, the future is looking pretty bright for
   **rPath** and I’m very excited to be a part of it all! I managed to
   hack on a proof of concept for a **Django**-based tool for our **QA**
   department which received a good deal of good feedback! I’ve also
   spent some time cleaning up our wiki and getting things ready for the
   new QA engineer who’s starting in a few weeks.
-  `Foresight Linux <http://www.foresightlinux.org>`__, my distribution
   of choice for the last 3 years, has undergone a lot of updates and
   changes these last few weeks, including a new sub-project called
   “\ `Boots <http://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/boots/Home>`__\ ”,
   a **Fedora** remix. Basically, “Boots is proposed to be as faithful
   as possible an import of the upstream binary platform packages,
   within the constraints of being repackaged for **Conary** using
   **Conary** best practices.” Also, as **Foresight** follows a rolling
   release model, I’m enjoying having latest **Firefox, Chromium, kernel
   2.6.30.x, Xorg 7.4, OpenOffice 3.1.1** only an update away. **GNOME
   2.28** is already in our development label and should be hitting the
   stable branch soon!
-  Speaking about **GNOME**, the Brazilian translation team went through
   a (**much needed**) last minute change in the coordination and the
   entire team rallied to deliver, once again, a completely translated
   desktop! Though the new coordinator lacks experience using git and
   managing a translation team, he makes up with a good attitude and
   humility.
-  Still talking about translations, I’ve been keeping the `Transifex
   Appliance <https://www.rpath.org/ui/#/appliances?id=https://rbatest02.eng.rpath.com/api/products/transifex>`__
   up to date on both development and stable fronts. Thanks to the power
   of having a system version controlled management modelÂ under my
   finger prints, maintaining and delivering the appliance in synchrony
   with the development and release schedule of the the
   `Transifex <http://transifex.org/>`__ project is child’s play!
-  I spent some time playing with
   `Mallard <http://live.gnome.org/ProjectMallard>`__ and using it to
   implement a new `User
   Guide <http://github.com/omaciel/foresight-user-guide>`__ for
   **Foresight Linux**! In the next few weeks I will also port
   `Cheese <http://projects.gnome.org/cheese/>`__ to mallard so that
   they can also enjoy of this great documentation tool! Speaking of
   Cheese, I had the pleasure of lending a helping hand proofreading the
   `tour page <http://projects.gnome.org/cheese/tour>`__ and was honored
   that **Daniel Siegel** asked my permission to use my **daughter’s
   pictures** to show off the new 2.28 features! Thanks dude! :)
-  When not going nuts over the many different inspections needed for
   purchasing a house, reviewing and committing translations,
   maintaining packages and software appliances or spending quality time
   with my family, I try to keep up with my new year’s resolution from
   last year of reading a book every day during my lunch break. I’ve
   read quite a few books this year, some times juggling more than one
   book at a time. Lately I’ve been finishing up “\ **The Last of the
   Mohicans**" and am gearing up to start reading Â "`Emblem
   Divide <http://emblemdivide.wordpress.com/>`__\ ”, a novel by my good
   friend **Pete Savage**. My curiosity got the best of me and I just
   had to read the first page! :) The best part of the book in my
   opinion is not as much as all the “easter eggs” he sprinkled here and
   there, but the reason why he wrote it! Want to know about it? Check
   out the web site for the book! :)

I guess this is about it for now. If I haven’t replied to your email,
please accept my apologies. I have a pretty lengthy cue of emails to
reply and I’ll try to get back to you as soon as possible. Feel free to
ping me on **IRC** (nick is **OgMaciel** in pretty much all servers,
including **Freenode** and **GimpNet**) as your chances of getting a
reply will be much higher. :)
