As some of you may know, I’ve been doing a great deal of testing for
`rBuilder Online <http://www.rpath.com/rbuilder/>`__, rPath’s online
community service for all your GNU/Linux appliances needs. As a QA
Enginner I have a chance to play with the most innovative technologies
we create (and dare I say some of the coolest things in the
system/package management world?) before it hits the general public.

It is because of this work and my recent super involvement with our
products that I decided to create a videocast on how to create a virtual
GNU/Linux appliance using rBuilder Online. My objective is to show just
how easy it is to package your software and distribute it to as many
different environments and architectures without having to do a lot of
heavy lifting. This videocast is the first step toward this goal,
recorded this morning with no script or preparation what so ever. Please
be gentle. :)

Recently I have been working with another contributor for the
`XFCE <http://www.xfce.org>`__ desktop environment to build an appliance
with code pulled directly from their versioning source control
repository. This allow us to work with the applications as they
currently exist in development and work on any issues that are sometimes
hard to catch without actually using the software.
