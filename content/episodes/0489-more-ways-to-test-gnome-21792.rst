`Now <http://ken.vandine.org/?p=218>`__ you can test **GNOME 2.17.92**
using **QEMU**, **Microsoft VHD**, and **VMware**.

These images will be generated periodically so that you’ll always have
the latest, bleeding edge GNOME to play with! So if you’re involved with
documentation, translation, or development for the GNOME Project, and
don’t feel like building it yourself, this is the best form to test your
work before it gets released. Get your copy
`here <http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/foresight/release?id=5402>`__!
