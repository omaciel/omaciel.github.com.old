Today I complete yet another life cycle, version 3.2! Some bugs have
been fixed and the “application” seems to be a bit more robust. New bugs
I’m sure will be discovered (and hopefully reported too), and even a
“fork” seems to be stabilizing in the shape of my (almost) 5-year-old
daughter! ;)

This last year marked my de facto entry into the open source world!
Together with other people, we founded `Planeta Ubuntu
Brasil <http://planeta.ubuntubrasil.org/>`__, a blog aggregator
completely designed for brazilian portuguese speaking users, and helped
place the `Ubuntu Brasil <http://www.ubuntubrasil.org/>`__ community on
the map! I was also named the administrator for the `Ubuntu Brazilian
Portuguese
Translators <https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntu-l10n-pt-br>`__, a
“position” I am **extremelly** proud to maintain! I made many friends,
some just as passionate as me, but also got involved in a few
tribulations of my own due to some administrative decisions… but I am
certain that nobody can honestly doubt my enthusiasm, dedication, and
passion for the community. I have many plans and adventures planned for
this new life cycle, which hopefully I’ll be able to relate any success
or failures this dreamer may come across!
