I completely forgot to mention about this last Thursday’s first `Open
Source Alliance <http://opensource.meetup.com/53/>`__ meeting at
Paramus’ Panera Bread. I arrived earlier than everybody else despite the
really bad traffic on Route 4 West. The place was really crowded and I
couldn’t set up my laptop at the “usual” place by the conference room. I
ended up going to the couch by the front entrance. Armed with a hot cup
of coffee I proceeded to get boot my laptop and get some internet going…
About 15 minutes later I realized something fishy was going on with the
free wifi for I just could not get a working IP assigned. I also
realized that nobody had shown up yet. Another 10 minutes went by and I
just completely gave up on the wifi and took a walk to the back of
Panera to see if anybody was there… I started to wonder if the meeting
had been set to meet at a different Panera Bread, the one on 17 North.
Luckly there were 4 guys already there with their laptops. I quickly
grabbed my stuff and joined them for a very short meeting. Without the
wifi access and having only 20+ minutes left we didn’t really get much
accomplished. Steve (Open Source Alliance’s organizer), Murph
(Slashdot’s organizer) and I (for those who don’t know, I’m the
organizer for the Northern NJ Linux group) talked a bit about the
unification of our groups and it was decided that starting next month,
all individual meetings will be scheduled to coincide on the same
date/venue. April 11th will be the last un-unified Linux meeting of the
year and I’m planning to have a live install of Ubuntu. Hope to have a
good turn out.
