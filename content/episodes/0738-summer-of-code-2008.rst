So I submitted my idea for `GNOME’s Summer of
Code <http://live.gnome.org/action/diff/SummerOfCode2008/>`__ this year…
aaaaaand, it doesn’t seem to be very popular as it is currently
categorized as “\ `Underground
Ideas <http://live.gnome.org/action/diff/SummerOfCode2008/Ideas#head-31a92f6fad257380280f4d0602e71766fc2b8ac1>`__\ ”.
:)

Titled “\ **Enhance Damned Lies and integrate it with open-tran.eu**\ ”,
it basically tries to lure someone with time to add a little bit of
pizzaz to a site that I regularly use in order to proceed with my
translations. Now, no offense intended but how can something like
“\ **Individual Workspace Wallpapers**" be considered as "`Rockstar
Ideas <http://live.gnome.org/action/diff/SummerOfCode2008/Ideas#head-5d7f6a70f0012a3425d64b3740dc05bba1977726>`__\ "
compared to the benefits of improving the work flow of those who deliver
a GNOME Desktop completely translated every single release cycle? *sigh*

Anyhow, those of you who are interested in the same idea and want to
help expand it a bit more in order to get more attention, please chime
in.
