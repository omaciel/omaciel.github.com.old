It’s been a while since I last wrote anything, mostly due to a few new
changes that happened these last 3 weeks or so. Here’s a small list of
some of the things that I can remember right now:

-  My pet project
   `BillReminder <http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org/>`__ is now
   hosted in the GNOME SVN repository! It took me a while to get the
   right resources and free time to migrate everything, but I believe
   that it is now completed. The source code can be checked out from
   `here <http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/billreminder/>`__ and issues can
   be filed in
   `Bugzilla <http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=billreminder>`__.
   There’s also a new web site theme to go along with the changes,
   courtesy of my good friend `ElyÃ©zer Mendes
   Rezend <http://elyezer.com/>`__\ e.
-  With the move to GNOME SVN I was (obviously) granted commit access…
   and due to some schedule changes for the two current committers for
   the Brazilian translation team, I have now been performing
   translations reviews and commits. It is great to finally be able to
   do this as I already have been doing this type of work for the XFCE
   team.
-  Speaking of the XFCE team, I have been on top of the Brazilian
   Portuguese translations and the next release (coming soon I’m told)
   will be `100%
   translated <http://i18n.xfce.org/stats/index.php?mode=4&lang=trunk/pt_BR>`__!
-  I started attending one single class at the `University of North
   Carolina <http://unc.edu>`__ (here in Chapel Hill) and this Tuesday
   was my first day. The class, “Database Design”, is listed as a
   graduate level class but so far it’s been fairly easy to follow. As I
   already have a bacchelors in BioChemistry, I’m looking forward to
   taking some bioinformatics classes in the near future.
-  I’ve done some travelling these last 2 weeks. Two weekends ago we
   went to the `North Carolina
   Aquarium <http://www.ncaquariums.com/ff/ffindex.htm>`__ at Fort
   Fisher. It was the first time I went to the Carolina beaches since I
   moved here and it was a great experience! We took lots of pictures
   and spent 2 great days soaking up in the sun!

-  Last weekend we went do Ocean City in Delaware to celebrate my
   youngest’s sister wedding. My whole family got together and rented a
   nice house in a fancy complex with lots of activities. There was a
   lot of swimming and drinking beer with my dad and older sister. Every
   night we would go to where my younger sister was holding the
   reception, a nice house by the lake with its own private pier! There
   was a lot of drinking, eating, and the occasional fishing off the
   pier! The evenings were amazing with a full moon and even some
   fireworks (we don’t know who was doing it, but it looked really great
   from where we were). Needsless to say my kids loved it all!
   Unfortunately we forgot our camera there and now I have to wait for
   my sister to mail it back.

Well, I actually have more stuff but that will have to wait for an
upcoming post.
