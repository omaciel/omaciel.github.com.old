This article was inspired by another article from my good friend `Alex
Rocha <http://alexrocha.wordpress.com/>`__, who has just taken the
plunge into the blogging world, pointing out a document showing how one
can create their own customized Live CD with Ubuntu Dapper Drake.Ã‚Â 
The
`document <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization/6%2e06>`__
is a detailed step by step which could help you create a Live CD with
all your favorite programas, including all the **multimedia codecs**,
**flash**, and **java** for a complete “out-of-the-box” experience,
specially if you’re trying to convince your aunt or grandparents to
migrate from Windows 98.Ã‚Â  |;)| But in order to complete such feat, it
is necessary to roll up your sleves and get jiggy with the command line,
which could be a bit “scary” for those who haven’t yet experience the
true power that Linux has to offer.Ã‚Â  That’s when I came across a
reference to a `graphical
nterface <http://lichota.net/%7Ekrzysiek/projects/ubuntu-livecd-customization/>`__
that pretty much does the same thing for you!Ã‚Â  I took a quick peek at
the instructions, shockfull of pictures, and I can say that now anyone
can create their own Live CD!Ã‚Â  I haven’t tried it yet but would love
to hear from those who manage to give it a whirl before I get a chabce.
Enjoy it!
