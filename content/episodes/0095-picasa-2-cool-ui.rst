I needed to do some image editing the other day and didn’t feel like
installing anything “big and complicated” like Photoshop or PSP.
Google’s `Picasa <http://www.picasa.com/>`__ software came to mind and I
quickly downloaded it on my laptop. I misy tell you that I’m very
impressed with user interface. Not as much with the features (which by
the way are just enough for your daily crop-resize-remove red eye needs)
but the looks of it! It has this Mac OS X-ish feel to it and it just
plainly looks cool! I want my next application to look like that… very
sexy and pleasing to the eyes… I find myself leaving it running so I can
look at it from time to time! Hehehe I also like the fact that it
automatically detects any new picture I save to my computer and makes an
entry for it in the application. For those who don’t spend as much time
in front of a computer as I do, this should be the ideal situation for
when you plug in a digital camera to a pc. No matter how or when a new
picture is stored into your computer, you can always see it in Picasa.
