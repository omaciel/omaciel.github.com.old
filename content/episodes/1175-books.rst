Woke up this morning and, as usual, sat down to read the **Books**
section of **The New York Times** while drinking my coffee. This has
become sort of a 'tradition' for me and because of it I have been able
to learn about many interesting books, some of which I would not have
found out on my own. I also 'blame' this activity to turning my
nightstand into a mini-library on its own.

Currently I have the following books waiting for me:

-  `The Oxford Book of Latin American Short
   Stories <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19651089-the-oxford-book-of-latin-american-short-stories?ac=1>`__
-  `The New Yorker
   Stories <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7841455-the-new-yorker-stories?ac=1>`__
-  `The Collected Tales of Nikolai
   Gogol <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/252981.The_Collected_Tales_of_Nikolai_Gogol?ac=1>`__
-  `Doctor
   Zhivago <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/130440.Doctor_Zhivago?from_search=true>`__
-  `Redshirts <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13055592-redshirts?ac=1>`__
-  `Dubliners <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11012.Dubliners?ac=1>`__
-  `The House of Seven
   Gables <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/90192.The_House_of_the_Seven_Gables?ac=1>`__
-  `Lolita <Lolita>`__

Anyhow, while drinking my coffee this morning I realized just how much I
enjoy reading and (what I like to call) catching up with all the books I
either read when I was younger but took for granted or finally getting
to those books that have been so patiently waiting for me to get to
them. And now, whenever I'm not working or with my kids, you can bet
your bottom dollar that you'll find me somewhere outside (when the
mosquitos are not buzzing about the yard) or cozily nestled with a book
(or two) somewhere quiet around the house.

But to the point of this story, today I realized that, if I could go
back in time (which reminds me, I should probably add "`The Time
Machine <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2493.The_Time_Machine?ac=1>`__\ "
to my list) to the days when I was looking to buy a house, I would have
done two things differently:

1. wire the entire house so that every room would have a couple of
   ethernet ports;
2. chosen a house with a large-ish room and add wall-to-wall bookcases,
   like you see in those movies where a well-off person takes their
   guests into their private libraries for tea and biscuits;

I realize that I can't change the past, and I also realize that perhaps
it is a good thing that I took my book reading for granted during my
high school and university years... I don't think I would have enjoyed
reading "`Dandelion
Wine <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50033.Dandelion_Wine?ac=1>`__\ "
or "`Mrs.
Dalloway <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14942.Mrs_Dalloway?from_search=true>`__\ "
as much back then as I when I finally did. I guess reading books is very
much like the process of making good wines... with age and experience,
the reader, not the book, develops the maturity and ability to properly
savor a good story.
