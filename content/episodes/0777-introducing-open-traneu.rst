Everyone who works with the translation of free and open source software
must know the web site `Open-Tran.eu <http://pt_br.open-tran.eu/>`__ (if
you don’t, I highly recommend it!), a translation repository online.

To quote `Jacek <http://sliwerski.net/>`__, the brain behind the
project:

    Proprietary software vendors may (if they can afford it) use CAT or
    TM software in order to ensure the consistency of their
    applications’ terminology. Unfortunately, there are many different
    software vendors who are not willing to share their knowledge (which
    includes translation memory databases) with the others. And this is
    where the open source software could prove to be better than the
    proprietary. It could, but is not. Although everybody has full
    access to the translations of many open source programs, this
    opportunity is hardly ever used. The knowledge of hundreds (if not
    thousands) of people translating applications into their native
    languages is not centralized and thus hardly available to the
    others. This is the reason why the translations of even the most
    popular programs are not consistent with each other, which
    discourages people from using them. I’d like the Open-Tran.eu
    service to fill this gap and to provide the translators with a
    useful tool, which may improve the quality of their translations and
    increase the consistency of terminology in the open source
    software.Â·

One cool thing about this service is that you can observe problems with
the standardization of terms within a project, where certain
applications may have a term translated one way, and completely
different on other applications. Want to see a nice example? Type the
word “plugin” in the search field or clique this
`link <http://pt_br.open-tran.eu/suggest/plugin>`__, to see the
discrepancies of how it was translated across several projects.

Want to see something even cooler? You could write a fairly simple
application to access this gold mine, and fetch the information you need
via the **XML-RPC** interface, a nice touch to the mix! Check out the
provided python script!

Today Jacek informed me that Open-Trans.eu has included the translations
for the `XFCE <http://www.xfce.org>`__ project, augmenting the
repository and definitely making my life a whole lot easiet when
analysing the Brazilian Portuguese translations for the project.
