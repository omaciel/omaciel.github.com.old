Thanks to the amazing support from the **GNOME Travel Committee**, I
will be attending my first
`GUADEC <http://www.grancanariadesktopsummit.org/>`__ this year in Gran
Canaria! I am very thankful for their commitment to accomodate my needs
and I’ll try to make the most of it!

I’ll be arriving July 3rd around lunch time and will stay until the
11th, so there will be plenty of time to meet up and discuss. I’m mostly
interested in localization, accessibility, and tests automation but am
equaly interested in community building and the organization toward
GNOME 3.0!

If you see some really fast crutches running around the terminals in
Boston or Madrid, come by and say hi to me! :)
