From the Gentoo documentation page:

    “\ *The Gentoo Installer project aims to create an widely extensible
    install engine that allows for a diverse set of attended and
    un-attended install options. All functionality will exist in the
    backend, exposed through a stable API. Planned front ends include
    text, gtk2, fully automated, and web-based interfaces.*\ ”

I’m a somewhat “seasoned” `Gentoo <http://www.gentoo.org/>`__ Linux user
and have performed the installation (and post installation maintenance,
etc) process several times on a few different plataforms. Eventhough the
documentation pages do a great job at explaining the steps involved in
installing and running Gentoo, I can see how someone with little
experience in Linux (specially the command line) would run away from
this distro. The installation is painfull and it takes a loooong time.
Granted you’ll end up utilizing all the resources your machine has to
offer when the smoke clears, but most users won’t really notice any
difference. This graphical installer should attract more users and one
won’t have to print out (or have a separate console with Lynx browsing
the documentation pages) the massive installation manual. I really hope
the die-hard command line lover, orthodox Gentoo users will support this
new project!

**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted this I found out that
`Gentoo <http://www.gentoo.org/>`__ Linux 2005.1 has just been released.
No word whether it contains the new installer or not.
