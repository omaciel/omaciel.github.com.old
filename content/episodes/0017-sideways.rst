On a previous post I had promised to comment on the movie
`Sideways <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375063/>`__. I finally managed
to see it while visiting my sister in North Carolina and was very
pleased with the movie as a whole. The cast, the plot, the
cinematography, the dialogues, everything contributed to a pleasant
comedy-drama. **Paul Giamatti** (Miles) and **Thomas Haden Church**
(Jack) take you on a roller coaster of emotions, making you ponder about
your own choices in life as well as make you piss in your pants with
their outrageous adventures. I won’t get into what the plot of the movie
is (you can check it out by clicking on the link above) but I will
garantee you will not be disappointed! It is yet another great example
that a movie doesn’t have to show tasteless nudity or have a star-filled
cast or be completely rendered with special effects in order to be good.
Since wine tasting plays a major role in the movie, one can’t help but
long for a tall glass of red wine by the time it’s over (but **NO
MERLOT**!!!) :)
