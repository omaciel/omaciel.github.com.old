I didn’t really know what I was getting into when I was told to attend
“a class” at work starting today. To be honest, I wasn’t very thrilled
about the idea but since I didn’t think I had a choice, I prepared
myself to spend some long, boring hours at the “class room.” Well, it
turns out that besides learning to use a project management tool called
Primavera, we are also learning what it takes to professionaly managed a
project (from the IT perspective). I am actually completely **awake**
and really enjoying the experience of “playing” the software manager for
a ficticious company. I’d say this is the closest I have ever gotten to
learning how to properly manage something. It has got to be also the
first time I didn’t fall asleep during any type of training I’ve been to
in a long time! By this Friday I should be in good shape to add this as
a new skill under my belt and my resume.
