on the London bombing and how politicians are seizing the moment to run
their personal agendas…

    Do people really believe that the goal of the terrorists is to
    destroy our freedom? Or that they hate our way of life? (E.g, Tony
    BlairÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remarks). IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be interested to know the origin
    of this themeÃ¢â‚¬â€?at some point, the cold war anti-Soviet
    rhetoric was somehow adapted to the war on terror.

Fear is still the weapon of choice for crowed control!
