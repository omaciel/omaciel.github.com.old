I was wondering if anyone out there would have a “recipe” for doing live
broadcasting (and podcasting) using only open source applications?Ã‚Â 
The goal is to replace our
record-from-**Skype**-conversation-with-**Audacity**-and-convert-to-ogg
“process” and eventually have sort of a “live” program where people
could listen to a weekly talk and/or download the podcast as well.
