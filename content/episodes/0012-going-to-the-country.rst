The day I fly to North Carolina has finally arrived. I’m **extremelly**
excited about this trip for it could be the kick in ass I need to get
back on track with my goals. I’ll be staying at my younger sister’s
apartment which I believe is near the `UNC <http://www.unc.edu>`__'s
Chapel Hill campus. She's already scheduled 4 interviews with the chairs
of 4 different departments and I have just emailed her to try to get me
2 more. I can already feel my brain itching with all the ideas that are
coming up to the surface after having spent almost 8 years in the back
burner. I guess the itch turned into a major rash the day I drove past
the MIT campus while visiting `Vinny <http://blog.supertoadman.com>`__ 2
weeks ago. I joked that if you could tune in your brain to listen to the
“brain waves” being transmitted near the campus you’d see how much
information was being generated. More than ever I’m convinced that I
belong in the academic and research worlds and am wasting away working
as a “mercenary coder.” I have this gut feeling that this trip could be
the one that will change my life for the best!
