It seems that my post didn’t quite express what I really meant and some
people (`Olav
Vitters <http://blogs.gnome.org/ovitters/2007/11/26/purpose-of-an-election/>`__
has asked me to mention his name instead of making it generic) have even
decided no to vote for me because of it. Wow… For instance, my good
friend Luis
`quoted <http://tieguy.org/blog/2007/11/26/information-is-the-essence-of-good-elections/>`__
me on his last post and based on what he wrote one would think I’m
telling people to shut up and just vote. This is **not** what I meant at
all and I can only blame myself for not making it clear. So, just to
clarify things, there are better ways to express your opinion and
calling someone “a psychotic failure, obstructive and destructive” is
not the correct and civil way. Does it make it any less valid if
expressed “forcefully”? No. But look at it any way you want, there is no
excuse. period!

As far as the person who’s decided not to vote me because of my post,
I’m sorry you feel this way, specially because you are judging me based
on a post. I’m sure however that you will vote for someone who will
defend the Foundation and community’s best interest, so good luck.
