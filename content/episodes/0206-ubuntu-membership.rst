Tomorrow will be a very important to me! At exactly 14:00 UTC I’ll be
presented to the `Ubuntu Community
Council <https://launchpad.net/people/communitycouncil>`__ for approval
to become part of the `Ubuntu
Member <https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntumembers>`__ Team! I have
spent quite some time helping out the Brazilian Ubuntu community these
last 2 months and I think I’m ready for the next level of involvement!

The meeting will take place via IRC and I can barely wait to see what
comes out of this!
