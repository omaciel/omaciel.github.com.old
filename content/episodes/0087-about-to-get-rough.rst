About To Get Rough

Today all consultants working for my current employer received the email
below (contents changed to protect the innocents):

    As the old-timers among you know, I periodically ask the IT
    consultants the gross annual or hourly pay you receive from your
    respective consultant firm. This information helps us determine the
    salary range and level of equity among the consultants of each work
    type/skill set; check that the consultant firm margins are somewhat
    reasonable, etc. Please return e-mail (to me only) the following
    info: - your gross hourly or annual rate (hourly is preferred) -
    whether you are working as an employee (with benefits), per diem or
    a corporation - directly with or via a subcontractor firm to one of
    the [employer’s name] consultant firms.

When I replied asking if this was optional I recieved a sounding NO!

Now, I’m not a lawyer or vaguely familiar with any labor regulations out
there, but.. How is this legal??? I think that besides the person in the
payroll system of my company, my dad, and my wife, nobody else knows how
much I make. Not legally at least! Instead of replying with some fake
information (someone suggested I should write I was getting paid $200K
just to see their reaction) I decided to avoid any confrontation and
wait to see what happens. You see, this is my personal information and
**unless** my employer is willing to trade my information for what
exactly they’re paying my agency, I don’t see how this is of their
business or how beneficial this will be to me. It is not like they’re
planning on giving anyone some type of compensation for being underpaid.
This really ticked me off at first but I decided that it was not worth
loosing hair over it now. If the going gets rough I’m ready to defend my
provacy and my rights!
