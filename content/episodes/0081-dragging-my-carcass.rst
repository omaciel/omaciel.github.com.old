Been really busy attending the Project Management class these last 3
days. It’s been very interesting but there’s a lot of material and
concepts to absorb. The end product of this is that I get home
completely drained and just pass out! Been “running” off of a million
cups of coffee and caffeinated snacks… Still haven’t had a chance to
play with Perforce and have 4 new books awaiting for me at home. Hope to
be able to do some hacking over the weekend since my new toy/hobby
application (RssReader.NET) has been neglected for some time now… Damn
it!!! Class started…
