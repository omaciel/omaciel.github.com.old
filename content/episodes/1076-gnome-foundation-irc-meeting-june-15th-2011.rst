Howdy fellow GNOMErs!

I’d like to invite you all to join us once again for another **GNOME
Foundation IRC Meeting**!

    **When**: Wednesday, June 15th, from 14:00 to 15:00 UTC (`your local
    time <//timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=15&month=6&year=2011&hour=14&min=0&sec=0&p1=0>`__)
    **Where**: irc.gnome.org, #foundation

Foundation IRC meetings are just that, meetings held on #foundation in
irc.gimp.org to discuss current matters related to the GNOME Foundation.
Any GNOME Foundation member or non member are welcome. As long as
you contribute positively to the discussion you are welcome.

The meeting is moderated by Board members that are present, and they
will guide the discussion through all the Agenda topics. Everyone
can comment and speak at any time, just remember to be respectful and
concise so it’s easy for everyone to follow the discussion.

Tthis is a great opportunity to discuss the topics you care about, or to
get more information from the Board if you think we’re not communicating
enough on some topics ;-) The agenda of the meeting is really up to you!

So please add the agenda items you’d like to discuss
to \ `http://live.gnome.org/FoundationBoard/MembersAgenda <http://live.gnome.org/FoundationBoard/MembersAgenda>`__

Your topics will automatically appear on the meeting page:
`http://live.gnome.org/FoundationBoard/MeetingAgenda <http://live.gnome.org/FoundationBoard/MeetingAgenda>`__

For reference, the minutes of the last meeting are available at:
`http://live.gnome.org/FoundationBoard/Minutes/ <http://live.gnome.org/FoundationBoard/Minutes/>`__

Thanks,

Og Maciel, on behalf of the GNOME Board of Directors
