That is what the new version of `Foresight
Linux <http://foresightlinux.org/>`__ will offer with its new
forthcoming version 2! I heard the news from
`Ken <http://ken.vandine.org/>`__ (Foresight’s leader and co-worker)
last night and it has been confirmed by
`Elliot <http://blog.bentlogic.net/>`__, our Anaconda tamer. Obviously
your installation time may vary depending on your system, but I’m fairly
sure they’ve used a standard PC for this. Another worthy mention is the
addition of `PackageKit <http://www.packagekit.org/>`__ as the graphical
interface for our `Conary <http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary>`__ package
management system and we will definitely make a big splash with the
addition of the `Splashy <http://splashy.alioth.debian.org/wiki/>`__
boot splash! As always, you can expect the latest goodness from GNOME
2.20.1 and the latest versions of your favorite apps!
