Just created the following **Ubuntu Brainstorm** idea called
“\ `Translation workflow and collaboration with
upstream <http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/13571/>`__\ ”. It is based
off the
`blueprint <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/rosetta/+spec/translation-workflow-and-notification-system>`__
I created a while back in an attempt to improve the relationship between
Ubuntu and upstream translation projects.

Everyone who knows me well knows how important translations are to me!
How I strive to get people to always work with upstream and then let
their work trickle down to distributions! Want to get me talking non
stop? Ask me about translations! :)

I want to ask everyone and anyone who wants to see a better workflow and
integration between Ubuntu and upstream projects such as GNOME, KDE,
XFCE, Openbox, etc to vote for my idea and help me get people talking
and working toward a better approach to this topic. Please vote **now**!
And tell your friends!!!
