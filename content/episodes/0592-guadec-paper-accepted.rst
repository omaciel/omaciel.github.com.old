Last week I was pleasantly surprised to see the following message in my
inbox:

    Hi, (apologies for the delay in sending this acceptance mail) Your
    lightning talk has been accepted for the Lightning Talk session at
    GUADEC 2006, in Birmingham UK. Ã‚Â If you have not already
    registered for GUADEC, you should register now at
    `http://guadec.org/registration <http://guadec.org/registration>`__.
    We look forward to seeing you at GUADEC! Ross Burton GUADEC Papers
    Committee

A couple of friends had motivated me to submit my
`talk <http://guadec.org/node/601>`__ and I was so looking forward to
finally meet them face to face.Ã‚Â  But alas, the announcement came a
few weeks too late as I have already made a commitment at work during
this period, as well as scheduled my vacation.Ã‚Â  To top it off, I
haven’t received my American passport yet and without it I cannot leave
the country!

I would like to thank the GUADEC Papers Committe for the opportunity and
hope to be able to attend it next year!
