Yesterday, following the announcement that the folks behind the
`Opera <http://www.opera.com>`__ web browser were giving away
registration keys (the FREE part is implied) in celebration of their
10th anniversary, I too took the time to download a Linux version to see
what the big deal was.

`Opera <http://www.opera.com>`__ is yet another web browser that is
freely available for several different operating systems (Linux and
Windows included) with a small caviat: The un-registered version has a
toolbar-like banner displaying adds while you browse. I never really
gave it a chance and completely gave up on it… maybe the banner had
something to do with it… You see, I don’t mind paying for software that
I like! I have actually bought packaged Slackware and Red Hat CDs after
the fact that I had been using them for quite some time… It was my way
of thanking all the developers behind their respective distributions for
all their time and effort. I have also paid for my dad’s Zone Alarm Pro!
But I am very happy with Mozilla Firefox and figured it made no sense to
buy something for something else at the time.

Shortly after I arrived home from work I checked my email with the
registration key (they sent me one for pretty much all operating systems
supported) and proceeded to install it. Within literally seconds I was
off browsing the web. So far I don’t have any feelings toward it and
haven’t seen any differences besides the UI. Some people have claimed it
to be much faster than Firefox but I’m yet to see this performance. I’ll
make a concious effort to use Opera for 1 week to give it a proper
chance and maybe will post back here what my finds were.
