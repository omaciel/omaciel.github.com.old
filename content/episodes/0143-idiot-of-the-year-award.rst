… goes to 18-year-old Scott Harper of Armonk, N.Y., who “plunged from
the upper deck at Yankee Stadium onto the screen behind home plate
during Tuesday night’s game between New York and the Chicago White Sox,
then was taken to a hospital for observation.”
(`ESPN <http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2130264>`__)
