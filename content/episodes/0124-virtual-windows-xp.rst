Here is what’s kept me up late these last 3 nights: Installing `Gentoo
Linux <http://www.gentoo.org>`__ onto **Houdini** (AMD 64 3400+ 1GB RAM)
and getting Windows XP to run under `VMWare <http://www.vmware.com>`__.
This may be a bit unorthodox but I wanted to have access to some
Windows-only applications (such as Visual Studio 2003) without having to
keep an extra computer at home with the sole purpose of running Windows.
I wonder if I can install and play
`WoW <http://www.worldofwarcraft.net>`__ under this scenario without
much of a performance loss???

I chose to go with `Fluxbox <http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net>`__ and some
other “light-weight” applications since I don’t really need a lot of GUI
to do what I want. I’m not sure if all the new
`Mono <http://www.mono-project.com>`__/C#-based applications have been
ported to x86-64 yet but I want to install
`F-Spot <http://www.gnome.org/projects/f-spot/>`__,
`Blam! <http://developer.imendio.com/wiki/Blam>`__ and be able to do
some GUI programming with C# too.

Firefox <http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/central.html>`__,
`Torsmo <http://torsmo.sourceforge.net>`__,
`Gaim <http://gaim.sourceforge.net/>`__,
`Eterm <http://www.eterm.org/>`__, and
`VMWare <http://www.vmware.com>`__.
