Arrived at Chapel Hill, NC early this morning and drove around the Duke
West Campus to find out where I have to be tomorrow for my interview.
The flight was great and the wi-fi hotspot at the airport (JFK) allowed
me to get things done while waiting for my flight.

Tried to subscribe to the University of North Carolina Linux User Group
(UNCLUG) to see if we could get together or something but had my request
rejected for not using a @unc.edu email address.Ã‚Â  Soooo… anyone from
UNCLUG interested in getting together?
