I just received an email stating what I thought would be inevitable:Ã‚Â 
Linux World Expo & Conference will no longer be held in Boston!Ã‚Â  Add
to that the fact that it hasn’t been held in NYC for the last 2 years,
this could mean the end of my long streak of participation at the event!
:/

Year after year the event took on a more business-like approach, and
colorfull couches and hang out areas were slowly converted to formal
meeting lounges and the geeks were no longer the majority in
attendance.Ã‚Â  Instead, a whole new “harvest” of business people took
over and you could just feel that unless you had something to sell,
people wouldn’t spent too much time with you.

I highly doubt I’ll be able to attend the lonely survivor LWE & C event
at the Moscone Center in San Francisco and this makes me deeply sad…
