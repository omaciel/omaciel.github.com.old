My daughter’s daycare was closed today due to the weather. Eventhough
there’s less than 2 inches of snow on the ground they decided that it
was safer not to open today. I think they just used a very lame excuse
to have a day off and since they get paid no matter what, it doesn’t
hurt them in the pocket.

So today I brought my daughter to work with me for the first time.
The poor thing was completely overwhelmed by the number of people who
crammed my cubicle to say hello. The plan was to keep her entertained
for 8 hours and do my job at the same time. Less then 3 hours later she
had drawings all over the place, together with cookie crumbs and a thin
layer of apple juice smeared over my desk. That’s when she said the
words I had feared all morning long: “I wanna go home.” I tried, in
vain, to convince her to stay but right about then she started to cough
really bad coupled with a persistent running nose. Ten minutes later we
were both out the door on our way home. I think it was the best decision
after all for she was in need of medication and a cozier place to hang
out than my co-worker’s chair. We’re home now and after lunch and
medication she’s peacefully sound asleep next to me in the couch.
