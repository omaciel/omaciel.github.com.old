I officially screwed up my site!!! I completely fucked it up!!! It turns
out the instructions on how to upgrade
`WordPress <http://www.wordpress.org>`__ to version 1.5 are incorrect
and I ended up deleting ALL of my posts! Hopefully I can get a copy of
the most recent backup, assuming there is one to get! I know some of you
are probably saying: “Hey idiot!!! Did you remember to back up
everything **before** upgrading???” Obviously, the answer is “No!” This
is not the first time I upgrade my blog and the instructions were very
much right on the money before…

Oh well, let’s see what happens now.
