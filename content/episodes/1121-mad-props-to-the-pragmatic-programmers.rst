Earlier this morning I received the following email from `The Pragmatic
Programmers <http://pragprog.com/>`__:

    Dear Og Maciel,

    This is just to let you know that *Pragmatic Guide to Git (eBook)*
    has recently been updated. You own an electronic version of this
    book, and so you’ll be able to download this latest version. We have
    also sent it to `Amazon.com <http://Amazon.com/>`__ for delivery to
    your kindle.

    **Changes in This Release**

    -  Third printing: includes a few minor errata fixes.

    You can get the update either by logging in to your **Bookshelf Home
    Page**, or (if you’re already logged in) by downloading it from
    **here**.

Awesome right? They not only have informed me of an updated version of a
book I bought from them, but have also automatically sent it to my
**Kindle**! More over, I can download my ebook in **PDF**, **mobi** or
**epub** format, all without any senseless “protection mechanism”. It is
this type of attention and treatment that have won me over and whenever
I need to buy a technical book, I immediately check their store.

Also worth mentioning is their monthly, free publication `PragPub
magazine <http://pragprog.com/magazines>`__, also available in many
different electronic types.

Anyhow, I don’t get any type of financial incentive for writing this up,
so don’t feel that I’m trying to push off some type of affiliation code
in order to make money. I happen to enjoy their service and attitude
toward their customers and, if you’re ever decide to buy anything from
them I hope your experience will be as enjoyable as mine.
