So here I am at `BarCampRDU <http://barcamp.org/BarCampRDU>`__, together
with the `rPath <http://www.rpath.org>`__ crew. Got to meet a few new
faces and am now sitting through my first session about distributed
version control with Bzr and Launchpad. So far it sounds very much like
Mercurial, which is pretty cool!

Anyhow, hope to be able to blog some more later today.
