My sister had told me about
`this <http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.04/robot.html>`__ when she
called to wish us a happy Easter. She was very excited about it and
thought I’d feel the same. For those of you who don’t read any “geek
news” or avoid any conversations that don’t relate to music videos or
movies: Wired magazine published an article in this month’s issue about
“\ *How four underdogs from the mean streets of Phoenix took on the best
from M.I.T. in the national underwater bot championship.*" The nature of
the contest is obscured and relegated to white-noise background and the
real meat of the article is to describe how these 4 illegal high school
immigrants were able to compete against and beat teams from some of the
best colleges in the nation. M.I.T.’s team must have been the most
famous participant for their name appears at least a dozen times in the
article. The contest itself comprised of maneauvering an aquatic robot
through an underwater (duhh) obstacle course as well as perform certain
tasks. Having managed only $800 of cash for support, these 4 kids had to
improvise and choose very carefully the building blocks for their bot:
::wikipedia("pvc","PVC"):: pipes and tampons were some of the items in
their arsenal. The whole story reminds me of when I went to high school
and had to take one of those standardized tests (was it the
::wikipedia("psat","PSAT")::?) required to graduate. While following the
oral instructions to fill out the first page of the test, one teacher
walking around the "immigrant section" of the library (we, immigrants,
had been segregated to this section of the library, away from the
"Americans") noticed that we **all** had finished filling out the tests
and were waaaay ahead of everybody else. He was so astonished that he
said to a guy sitting next to me: “I don’t care what *they* say about
you… I think you’re all very smart!” To this day I still wonder what
“\ *they*" thought of "*us*\ ”!!!
