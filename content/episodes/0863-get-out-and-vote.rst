If you are elligible to vote for the election taking place in the United
States of America, **please** excercise your right to vote. Go out and
vote to your candidate OR to whomever you feel will do their best to
represent your community’s best interest!

Also, if you live in **California** and meet the requirements to vote,
please consider voting **against** `Proposition
8 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8_(2008)>`__!

Today marks the first time I participated in any presidential election
ever in my life! It feels specially nice for me as this is also the
first time I vote for the leader of my adopted country! I don’t expect
that things will improve a whole lot in the next 4 years, regardless of
who wins tonight. But I voted not thinking of the present but the future
of our nation and what opportunities it will offer for the next
generation. There will be sacrifices to be made but it will all be worth
if we can deliver a better world to our kids!

**Please**, go out and vote!
