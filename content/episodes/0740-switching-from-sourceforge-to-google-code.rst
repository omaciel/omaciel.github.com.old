For the last 2 weeks I have (unsuccesfully) tried to migrate
`BillReminder <http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org>`__ from
SourceForge to `Google Code <http://code.google.com/hosting/>`__ project
hosting. I have filled out the web form to register a new project on
Google Code, but since this project already exists in SourceForge, I
have to go through an extra step where a message should be sent to the
project lead (which happens to be me) requesting approval for this
migration. The problem is that I always get a 500 page when I click on
the submit button!

There is definitely something borked in this process, for when I first
tried to go through this process, I would some times see a captcha box
above the button… and sometimes I wouldn’t! Regardless of whether I saw
(and obviously filled) the captcha field, I always ended up with the 500
error page.

Both of my emails to their
google-code-hosting-reservations@googlegroups.com contact email have
gone unanswered… No luck asking on #google at Freenode either. So…
anyone from `Google <http://www.google.com>`__ reading this post who can
lend me a hand?
