I was really glad to see **David Bolter**'s post today about
`transparency in community
decisions <http://mindforks.blogspot.com/2007/11/transparency-in-community-decisions.html>`__!
**Olav** and I had been talking about this (see
`comments <http://blogs.gnome.org/ovitters/2007/11/26/purpose-of-an-election/#commentlist>`__
section), related to blog aggregation requests, and it is nice to see
that someone else also agrees. Some people may complain about having to
create a user account (assuming we’re using **bugzilla**, for instance)
to request that his blog be aggregated to the planet, but this would
provide some sort of “receipt” and serve as a means to get a process
going. Obviously, it is also necessary some kind of control so that
`tickets <http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=497916>`__ don’t
just sit there and collect dust. :)
