If you hire people just because they can do a job, they’ll work for your
money. But if you hire people who believe what you believe, they’ll work
for you with blood and sweat and tears.

     I consider myself very lucky for having gotten to a point in my
professional career where I can chose where I want to work, a place
where I can try to make a difference, and more than anything, a place
where I believe in what I do! Thanks my good friend Joe Baltimore for
sharing this video today, a great way to kick off the weekend! `Simon
