Today we have released `rPath Appliance
Agent <http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/rPath_Appliance_Agent>`__ (rAA)
version 1.0.9!!! I’m very excited about this since it has 2 new features
that I worked on:

-  A new plugin for setting the time, date and timezone, and configuring
   the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
-  The rAA user password is now salted to provide additional security.

A long time ago I experienced the joy of seeing a program I had
developed and open sourced pick up over 30000 downloads on
downloads.com. But if you exclude my participation in the early stages
on the `AptOnCD <http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/develop.html#people>`__
project, I have exclusively developed applications for internal use only
ever since.

Obviously the new features include more than just these 2 items (full
blown release notes
`here <http://blogs.conary.com/index.php/rAA/2006/12/08/rpath_appliance_agent_1_0_9_released>`__),
but it is very exciting to know that bits and pieces of my code will be
powering many `Linux Appliances <http://www.rpath.com/corp/>`__ out
there! ;)
