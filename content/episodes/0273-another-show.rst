This April 22-23 I will be once again “on the road” to represent Ubuntu
Linux at this year’s `Trenton Computer
Festival <http://www.tcf-nj.org/ps>`__.Ã‚Â  Having just got
`back <http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=244>`__ from Linux World Expo in
Boston, this shouldn’t be too intimidating for me.Ã‚Â  I must confess,
it was pretty intimidating to face literally hundreds of people and
provide them with satisfactory answers.Ã‚Â  I feel a bit more “seasoned”
now and should be able to feel more confortable now.

Anyhow, any Ubunteiros out there in the Tri-State area interested in
lending me a hand?Ã‚Â  I also need some extra CDs to give out since I
pretty much ran out of the 600 CDs I had ordered for LWE in less than 2
hours!!!
