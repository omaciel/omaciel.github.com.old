I had a chance to interview `Igor Pires
Soares <http://igorsoares.com/>`__ from the **Fedora Project** and chat
about how he got started with translations, participating on several
organizing committees and his travels around the world! He talks about
**getting lost in Chile**, learning English and Spanish, the role his
university played on his career, his top 5 books, movies and his
interest in music, including a very special moment during a **U2 show in
São Paulo**. The interview is in Brazilian Portuguese, but anyone who
can speak Portuguese or Spanish should be able to enjoy it!
