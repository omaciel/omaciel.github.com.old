Woke up to the following email this morning:

    | Dear Og Maciel,
    | Congratulations on your one-year anniversary with Red Hat! Thank
    you for your commitment and work over the past year. We hope that it
    has been everything you expected it to be and look forward to
    celebrating your future success with the company.

Time sure flies when you’re having too much fun! I can’t believe it’s
been one whole year since I joined `Red Hat <http://www.redhat.com/>`__
as a **Senior QA Engineer** to work on their
`CloudForms <http://www.redhat.com/products/cloud-computing/cloudforms/>`__
project! So much has happened since then that it is a bit hard to
remember all the new and exciting things I had the pleasure of being a
part of! It is absolutely grate to be able to work on such a cool and
challenging environment, and to experience first hand what open source
and meritocracy really means!

I remember being asked during my interview process what my long-term
goals were (or something along these lines), and my answer was:

    "In the next 5 years I want to be the **Go To** person to all
    questions related to **CloudForms**!”

Well, one year down and four more to go! :)
