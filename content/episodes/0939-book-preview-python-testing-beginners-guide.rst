I was looking for some material on proper **python testing** in order to
improve my **QA** skills and after some “Googling” came across
“\ `Python Testing: Beginner’s
Guide <http://bit.ly/PythonTestingBook>`__\ ”. My first impulse was to
hit **Amazon** and see if they had it and if I could buy an **ebook**
version. Sadly, they only had the “dead tree” version, so I decided to
check if the publisher, `PackT Publishing <http://packtpub.com>`__, had
an alternative.

Boy, was I glad I hit their web site! Not only there was an ebook
version of that book, but they **do not password protect** them, giving
you complete control over your purchase!!! You can also\ **copy tex**\ t
from it, which makes your life really easy when you’re following along
and want to copy some of the code being described!

Needless to say I purchased the ebook version and have already allocated
my weekend to read it, so you can expect a review next week. In the
meantime, here’s a free chapter (PDF) for you to get a taste for the
book: `Chapter 5: When Doctest isn’t Enough: Unittest to the
Rescue <http://bit.ly/PythonTestingCh5>`__
