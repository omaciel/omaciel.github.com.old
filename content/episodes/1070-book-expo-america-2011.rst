Taking a day off tomorrow to fly to NYC with my oldest daughter so we
can both attend this year’s `Book Expo
America <http://www.bookexpoamerica.com/>`__ (BEA) at the **Javits
Center**. We’re both very excited about this chance of seeing so many
books and the possibility of meeting some of the authors, such as `Mo
Willems <http://mowillemsdoodles.blogspot.com/>`__! Unfortunately I’m
going to miss meeting `James Dashner <http://www.jamesdashner.com/>`__
as he’s scheduled to give out sample chapters of his upcoming book only
on Wednesday.

This will also be the first time I travel anywhere with only one of my
kids, so I’m definitely looking forward to spending some quality time
with her and take a lot of pictures. For someone like us who enjoy
reading and think that the **public library** or Barnes & Noble are the
best place on earth to hang out, going to BEA should be something she
will never forget!
