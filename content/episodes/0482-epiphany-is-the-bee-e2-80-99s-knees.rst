I just have to agree with
`Foresight <http://www.foresightlinux.com/>`__'s
`decision <http://flinux.wordpress.com/2007/03/03/foresight-chooses-epiphany-as-new-default-browser-on-upcoming-release/>`__
to ship the **Epiphany** web browser as their default browser!
DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get me wrong, I like Firefox and some of the very nifty
extensions make some of my tasks a breeze (**Firebug** rules!), but
Epiphany **IS** GNOME’s default web broswer!

I say, take it for a spin and you’ll see how pleasant your experience
will be!
