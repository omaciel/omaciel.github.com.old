Amazing upgrade to the already amazing `Google
Maps <http://maps.google.com/maps>`__ site. Don’t really know when it
was implemented but you can now switch from the map view to a **real
satellite view**, down to the street level! I can only imagine the day
you’ll be able to have a live feed of traffic conditions via satellite
on your web browser of
`choice <http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/central.html>`__!
