This is more of a “feel good” post, mostly for me! Through my life I
have come across a fork on the road many times, and for the last 4+
years I have always chosen the path to the **right**. Even when the left
side sometimes looked a bit more “paved” and less difficult to walk
through, I still chose the **right path**! The reasons are many, but I
think I can distill them into one single sentence: I believe!

I’m talking about the technology that we develop here at
`rPath <http://www.rpath.com>`__ and apparently, I’m not the only one to
feel this way either! It makes me extremely proud to know that something
I work on is perceived as a game changer to a bunch of people!

    "The challenge that most IT organizations have today when it comes
    to the complexity of enterprise IT is an inability to visualize the
    relationships between all the moving parts that make up a specific
    IT service. While there has been some resistance to IT automation
    historically, it’s pretty clear that enterprise IT will not scale in
    this age of virtualization and cloud computing without it."- **Mike
    Vizard**, CTO **Edge**

    "The future of IT lies in storing system knowledge in an automated
    system and putting it to use when a new system is about to be
    unleashed." - **Charlie Babcock**, **InformationWeek**

    "There are two main strengths to [rPath X6]: The DevOps articulation
    is the major strength—configuring and releasing a new application or
    changes to an application is a process fraught with human errors.
    The complexity is such that issues are inevitable. These issues have
    a ripple effect on service quality and agility. The other major
    strength is the IT service supply chain that will play a major role
    in the future. IT will have a choice of delivery platforms that they
    did not have before [physical server, virtual server, public or
    private cloud]. Applications will need to be easily "movable" to any
    platform. This is where rPath has a big role to play." - **JP
    Garbani**, **Forrester**

    "Pity the poor admin whose job it is to keep track of all the
    versions of operating systems, applications and firmware and the
    interdepencies between them all, so as not to hit a conflict when
    installing or deinstalling something that brings everything grinding
    to a halt. In a cloud environment, when everything is virtualized it
    gets even harder to manage as resources are constantly being moved
    around." - **Jo Maitland**, **SearchCloudComputing.com**

    "rPath is an integral part of our strategy, providing a powerful
    solution for automating and standardizing how we turn applications
    into deployable systems and how we maintain and re-use them over
    time. For most companies this is a manual, cumbersome process, but
    rPath makes it simple and automated. We’re very excited about this
    next-generation version of rPath, in particular the dynamic and
    visual user experience and rich configuration management
    capabilities it introduces." - **Ed Seymour**, **Fujitsu**

    "Enterprise IT is undergoing a radical transformation fueled by
    scale and change, contracting budgets, and the growing need for
    speed, Because of massive system complexity and the need for rapid
    deployment and change, IT needs a new and better approach. They
    cannot achieve this quality without embracing an automated
    application release solution to ensure efficient, repeatable,
    accurate and reliable application deployments." - **Ronni
    Colville**, **Gartner**
