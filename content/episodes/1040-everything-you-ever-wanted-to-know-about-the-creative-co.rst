A while back my friend **Karlisson Bezerra**, author of the
**Brazilian** **comic** (all using open source tools such as
**Inkscape**, etc) \ `Nerdson <http://nerdson.com/blog/>`__, created a
pretty nifty story explaining how to use the `Creative
Commons <https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Creative_Commons>`__
license. The `original
strip <http://nerdson.com/blog/criativos-comuns/>`__ was written in
Brazilian Portuguese but someone took the time to do a quick translation
into English (as the translator is not a native Brazilian Portuguese
speaker, some things got lost in the translation, but the end result is
still worth checking). So here is the finished work, enjoy it!
