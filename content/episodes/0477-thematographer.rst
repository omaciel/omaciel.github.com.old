I took advantage of an unexpected break I had over the weekend to create
my own application to change the theme for OpenBox. Sure, I know there’s
OBConf, but I wanted to write my own in python.

Without further ado, I present version 0.1 of
`Thematographer <http://www.ogmaciel.com/thematographer.tar.gz>`__ for
OpenBox!

|thematographer|

Even with the dependency on Glade, I find it to be very light and it
will detect default themes installed, as well as themes installed on
$HOME/.themes.

More articles on OpenBox to come.

**Update**: `Kristoffer Gronlund <http://www.undiscoverable.com/>`__ has
made some modifications to the code, which can be obtained
`here <http://www.undiscoverable.com/2007/02/23/thematographer-modified>`__.
I have incorporated some of it, to include changing the theme by
double-clicking the theme name. Thanks Kristoffer! ;)
