|New Chapter|

Last October I celebrated a couple of milestones in my life:

-  **5 years** living in **North Carolina**;
-  **2 years** since I bought my **first house**;
-  **11 years** married to **my wife**;
-  **5 years** working for **rPath**;

Needless to say, each one of those milestones were very important to me
as they mark important decision points in my life! Every single one of
them changed my life for the better and I can’t help but feel blessed
that I have so many things to look forward to at end of the year that
remind me how lucky I have been!

Last week was my also an important day for me, as I was offered and
accepted a job to work at **Red Hat** as a **Senior QA Engineer** for
their **CloudForms** team! I assure you that it was a bitter sweet
moment for me, for a really loved the work I had been doing at rPath.
But the chance to work on Red Hat’s cloud initiative was too much of a
temptation for me to pass! I have been truly blessed for having had the
chance to join rPath 5 years ago at a point where they were still trying
to establish themselves among the big technology providers out there.
Five years later they’ve accomplished their goal and I can look back and
feel proud that all the late nights, cancelled vacations and hard work
paid off!

This December I get to work on a very exciting project with a great
bunch of guys trying to accomplish a similar task! I am extremely
excited about the potential that CloudForms and its derivatives will
bring to the masses and I can only hope to be able to look back five
years from now and be able to celebrate another job well done!

**To infinity, and beyond!**
