My latests posts have attracted a fair number of comments (thank every
and each one of you for taking the time… really!), most of them in
response to the issue at hand. Every now and then someone questions the
validity of one of my chosen topics, claiming that it should be
published on Planet **X** (my blog is syndicated on quite a few planets)
because it doesn’t talk about technology. I understand that someone
people may not enjoy reading every single topic that may be published
(not only by me), for I am one of them… honest!

Anyhow, my friend `Jonathan Jesse <http://jjesse.wordpress.com/>`__'s
comment on my latest post got me thinking… maybe I should write
something about this same topic: what do I think about people writing
about anything on **Planet Ubuntu** for instance.

Now, Jonathan… I’m not picking on you bud. :)

    I wonder if political posts such as these really should be
    syndicated on something like planet.ubuntu.com. I know I have
    different political leanings then you based on the posts that Iâ€™ve
    read and I try to limit my posts to planets to only the topic on
    hand. Feel free to disagree with me. Thatâ€™s the beauty of freedom
    of speechâ€¦. I just hope that you arenâ€™t assuming that everyone
    who posts on planet.ubuntu.com or reads p.u.c agrees with your
    political ideas.

From the main page at `Planet Ubuntu <http://planet.ubuntu.com/>`__:

    Planet Ubuntu is a window into the world, work and lives of Ubuntu
    developers and contributors.

I most definitely do not assume that everyone who reads Planet **X**
agrees or shares my ideals and/or principals… it would be naive to think
that way, and just flat out against Ubuntu (the ideology, not the
distro)! Some people like to write howtos… some write about their
favorite recipes or music… I reserve my right to talk about the things
that are part of my life, sometimes about politics. I don’t expect that
every single subscriber will want to read every single word I write… as
I mentioned before, I don’t read everything I’m subscribed to. For those
posts that don’t tickle my fancy, all I have to do is press the “j” key
on Google Reader (or “n” on Liferea) and presto! A brand new post
automagically appears!

    I would like to hear your view on political posts appearing on
    something like planet.ubuntu.com

Fair enough. The short answer is: I’d be very interested to know this
facet of many of the contributors to open source that are syndicated on
these planets. You see, there’s much more about me than translations,
BillReminder or my interest in the political future of my nation. I also
love fishing, ice hockey, Clint Eastwood’s westerns, Reuben sandwiches,
and… and… so much more. Off course I don’t expect that everyone will
care about any of these. But there are a few people out there who find
this a reasonable way to know the real me, specially when one lives so
far away and with no means to meet in person.

The bottom line is that when my blog was added to Planet X, I was never
asked to only write about X, or to create a feed that only talks about
X. I’m not trying to wash my hands here, but this was the deal offered
to me… and I accepted it. Maybe people who control/administer these
aggregators will one day change their regulations in order to provide a
more specific and filtered content? Until then, I ask all of you
guys/gals who may be annoyed by some (all?) of my articles to simply
press the “x” key on your news reader of choice… and exercise your
freedom of choice.
