This Wednesday I embark on what may be the most important trip of my
life: I’ll be visiting and interviewing with the chairs of several
different departments at the `North Carolina
Univertsity <http://www.unc.edu/>`__ with the objective of gathering
information for my possible come back to the academic world. It’s been
almost 8 years since I graduated from `Pace
University <http://www.pace.edu>`__ and my plans of earning a PhD/MD
diploma have taken a major detour. From lab technician at `BD
Pharmaceuticals <http://bd.com/>`__, BioInformatics Programmer at
Synaptics Pharmaceutical (now part of
`Lundbeck <http://www.lundbeck.com>`__ Pharmaceuticals), and now VB.NET
Programmer for the `School Construction Authority of
NYC <http://www.nycsca.org>`__, I have often felt like a fish out of the
water. Computer programming has been a hobby of mine since I was given a
Sinclair ZX when I was 9 but being a scientist is what really gets my
blood flowing. I’m hoping that somewhere along this trip something will
click and help me get back in track with my dream of doing something
that will help those people all around the world who unfortunately were
born with some type of disability and cannot fully enjoy a “normal”
life. I strongly believe that everyone is *here* for a reason and I want
to do my best so that the meaning of my being here is to make someone
else’s life better! Hopefully I will be able to acchieve my goal as a
Tar Heel!
