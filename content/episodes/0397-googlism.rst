My younger sister showed me this site:
`Googlism <http://www.googlism.com/>`__.Ã‚Â  You type in your name, for
instance, and using Google, it returns things that have been associated
with it in the net.Ã‚Â  Here are some results I got with a few terms:

Sorry, `Google <http://www.google.com/>`__ doesn’t know enough about
**ubuntu** yet.
