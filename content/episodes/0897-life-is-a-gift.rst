I just had to share this with everyone. Have a great weekend!

    **Life Is a Gift** Today before you say an unkind word - Think of
    someone who can’t speak. Before you complain about the taste of your
    food - Think of someone who has nothing to eat. Before you complain
    about your husband or wife - Think of someone who’s crying out to
    GOD for a companion. Today before you complain about life - Think of
    someone who died too early on this earth. Before you complain about
    your children - Think of someone who desires children but they’re
    barren. Before you argue about your dirty house someone didn’t clean
    or sweep - Think of the people who are living in the streets. Before
    whining about the distance you drive Think of someone who walks the
    same distance with their feet. And when you are tired and complain
    about your job - Think of the unemployed, the disabled, and those
    who wish they had your job. But before you think of pointing the
    finger or condemning another - Remember that not one of us is
    without sin. And when depressing thoughts seem to get you down - Put
    a smile on your face and think: you’re alive and still around.
