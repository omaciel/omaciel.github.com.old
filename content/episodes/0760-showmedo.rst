Today I subscribed to `ShowMeDo, <http://showmedo.com>`__ a web site
dedicated to providing tutorials in the format of screencasts. The
tutorials cover many programming topics with Python being the one that
got me to get a paid subscription. I managed to watch a few episodes
during my lunch break… and was blown away at how easy it is to follow
the sessions!

Before anyone ask, I’m not getting paid for this plug… I know quite a
few people who have shown interest in learning Python but didn’t know
how to get started. If you follow a tutorial series, not only will you
learn some valuable skills, but you’ll also have a working project to
play with.

I highly recommend it!
