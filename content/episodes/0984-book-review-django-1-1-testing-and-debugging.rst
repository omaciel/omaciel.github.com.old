During this last weekend I finally managed to reserve a couple of hours
of “me time” to finish reading my complimentary copy of the book
â€œ\ `Django 1.1 Testing and
Debugging <http://bit.ly/DjangoTestingDebugBook>`__\ â€? from `Packt
Publishing <http://packtpub.com>`__!

Once again I felt completely absorbed by the style chosen for this Packt
Publishing book, as it makes use of a complete application to reinforce
all of the topics covered. You start with a brief explanation of the
benefits of testing your code and immediately start building a market
research application from scratch.

Every chapter is built on the previous one, covering topics such as
**doctests**, **unittests**, and adding coverage information and reports
via **Ned Batchelder**'s
`coverage <http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/>`__ script. You also
learn about using Django’s ï»¿ï»¿\ *django.test.Client* module and
`Twill <http://twill.idyll.org/>`__ to perform web testing and make sure
that what your users see in their web browser is valid content and what
they expected.

I liked the fact that several chapters were dedicated to showing you how
to properly **debug**, **log**, **and understand the information**
collected by these methods. Also how to fix any issues that may come up
during the development phase, as well as write tests to catch them! I
have definitely learned several new ways to look at debug information
that I will make sure to add to my arsenal. Some of the tools you’ll
learn include the awesome `Django Debug
Toolbar <http://github.com/robhudson/django-debug-toolbar>`__ (I wrote
about it `here <http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=874>`__) and even the `Python
debugger <http://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html>`__ (pdb), so if
you’ve never heard of either one or need a refresher, you’ll enjoy the
last chapters of this book.

By the time you’re done reading this book, you’ll have a complete market
researching tool, including some `Fancy
Nancy <http://www.fancynancybooks.com/>`__ charts generated by
`pygooglechart <http://pygooglechart.slowchop.com/>`__ or
`matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`__ AND instructions on
how to deploy it in a production environment and perform some load tests
using `siege <http://www.joedog.org/%20index/siege-home%20>`__!

Overall, this book offers good quality screenshots, clear and concise
directions and working source code to follow along! I recommend it for
anyone who’s doing Django development out there and would like to
improve the quality of their applications by adding (more) tests!
