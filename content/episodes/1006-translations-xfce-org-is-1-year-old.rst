Received the following

this morning:

    ::

        Last night our Transifex installation turned 1 year old. I think with
        101 users and  4012 submissions in 45 languages it has been quite a
        step forward compared to the previous mailing list-based submission
        system. For that I'd like to thank all the people involved, most
        noticeably Jannis for the initial setup, the Transifex guys for help
        and fixing bugs, Og for the appliance we've been running for the last
        half year and of course the Translators with all their patience and
        effort to make it a success.

        Cheers,
        The Xfce development team.

This has an extra special meaning for me, not only because I am one of
the **101** users contributing translations to the
`Xfce <http://www.xfce.org/>`__ project, or because I’m a huge supporter
of the work the `Transifex <http://transifex.org>`__ guys have been
doing, but because of their use of the `Transifex
Appliance <http://bit.ly/Transifex>`__!

You see, a while back I needed a “pet” project to use as a learning tool
to learn about creating, maintaining and deploying software appliances
with the technologies we develop here at
`work <http://www.rpath.com>`__. Transifex was the project that caught
my attention, mainly for being a tool for translators and for using
`Django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`__ under the hood.

I’ve been maintaining the Transifex Appliance for quite some time now,
all by my lonesome self and putting a lot of my free time. So it feels
great to hear that the appliance is being used in a production
environment and that it is used by several users!

So, congratulations to the **Xfce translators** and ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿\ **Nick
Schermer** for sticking with the appliance and providing tons of great
feedback on how to improve it!
