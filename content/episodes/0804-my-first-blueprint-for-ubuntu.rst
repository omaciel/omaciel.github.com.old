Today I created a blueprint I intend to promote for
`Launchpad <http://launchpad.net/>`__'s
`Rosetta <http://launchpad.net/rosetta/>`__ workflow. Titled “\ `The
process by which translation teams can better handle
collaboration <https://blueprints.edge.launchpad.net/rosetta/+spec/translation-workflow-and-notification-system>`__"
(and its matching full
`specification <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OgMaciel/blueprints/rosetta>`__),
it is my intent to describe a mechanism by which translation teams can
better administrate the contributions sent by Rosetta users, provide
useful feedback and take a first step toward a better relationship with
upstream projects.

I kindly invite those interested in the same topic to subscribe to the
blueprint and add their feedback to the specification page, specially
those who like me have their feet in both upstream and Rosetta worlds.
