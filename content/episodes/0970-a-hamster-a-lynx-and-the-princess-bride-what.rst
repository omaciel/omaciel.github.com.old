Got a couple of interesting bits for you today, starting with some
really great news from the `Hamster
Project <http://projecthamster.wordpress.com/about/>`__, a time tracking
application. My friend **Tom** wrote about his recent work decoupling
the communication layer from the client and the back-end, which will now
be handled by dbus. What that really means is that it will be easier to
script against hamster and tap into the data that it captures. Here’s a
simple code sample from Tom’s page:

::

    import from hamster.client
    storage = hamster.client.Storage()

    storage.get_todays_facts()  # or any other function for that matter

The future looks very bright and interesting for this project and Tom’s
`hamster experiments <http://github.com/tbaugis/hamster_experiments>`__
side project alone is worth your time (some really amazing visual
effects you can add to your project can be easily done by using his
library)!

Now, who on Earth did not hear about the latest
`Ubuntu <http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/1004features>`__
release yesterday? It was impossible to check your news feed or social
networks and not see the words “Lucid Lynx” splattered all over the
place! It’s been more than 3 years since I actually installed and used
Ubuntu, so due to some down time I had yesterday I decided to take a
peek at 10.04. As far as the user experience and friendliness, nothing
has changed. Ubuntu still provides one of the best experiences during
the installation of an operating system! From the helpful help text to
the spiffy “slides” they display as your system is being installed, it
is easy to see why so many have made Ubuntu their distribution of
choice.

Once the system was installed, the first thing that caught my attention
was the integration with social media through the handy applet in the
far right of the upper menu. Adding my Twitter, Identi.ca and Google
Talk information was a breeze but what really tripped me up was that I
expected to see the updates from my friends’ feeds to show up as a
notification “balloon”. The only time I received such a notification was
when someone actually mentioned my name, which does make sense I guess.
Also, it would be nice to either start the messenger client
(mission-control, is it?) on login if there is a network detected or
start it from the same indicator applet using one of those menu entries.
Maybe clicking on the “Available” entry should automatically start it in
the background? Anyhow, the overall experience was worth the time
downloading it and installing it on a virtual machine. The art and
attention to minute details shows how much work was put into it and for
the entire Desktop Experience (DX) Team I offer my most sincere
congratulations!

Finally, the other day I was shooting the breeze with the guys from
`work <http://www.rpath.com>`__ when
`Tom <http://www.winebythebar.com/>`__ (different Tom) said:

-  Tom: blah blah blah “\ `The Princess
   Bride <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/>`__"…
-  Me: What??? **Princess** bride?
-  Entire UI Team: You’ve never seen “The Princess Bride”?
-  Me: What is “The Princess Bride”?

What followed were several minutes of comments of disbelief and how
could I possible not have watched this movie. That’s when Tom challenged
me to ask “the internets” if I should watch it not.

Well, since it is Friday and all, why not then? :) Voice your opinion
`here <http://bit.ly/PrincessBrideForm>`__!

**Disclaimer**: I really don’t know anything about this movie, so no
spoilers, please. :)
