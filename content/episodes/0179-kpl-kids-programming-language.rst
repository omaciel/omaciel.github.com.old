KPL, or `Kid’s Programming
Language <http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/coolapplications/KPL/default.aspx>`__

    is modeled on the simplicity and readability of BASIC, but it is a
    structured rather than linear programming language. KPL lets kids
    see eye-catching and immediate results from their programs, while
    teaching them fundamental concepts like variables, data types,
    loops, decision structures, methods and functions. KPL’s data types
    include integers, decimals, strings, booleans, arrays, and
    user-defined structures.

Visual Studio users will feel right at home with KPL’s IDE as it will,
as the web page smartly states, “graduate” young coders to the more
professional interfaces. One thing that it did catch my eye was its C#
and VB.NET code generation from the KPL source.

Download it and start your young one early… ;)
