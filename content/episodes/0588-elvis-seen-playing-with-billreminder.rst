Just an update on the development for
`BillReminder <http://sourceforge.net/projects/billreminder/>`__. Real
life and work took a good hold of me these last 2 months and I had not
been able to stick to my personal roadmap… that is, until last week. The
programming itch attacked me again, and the result was several commits
along the week, completly stripping BillReminder of its Glade “skin” and
re-writing a lot of the code.

I must tell you, I am very happy with the outcome so far… The
applications “feels” snapier and I am learning a lot of new things along
the way too! My latest “battle” is really learning and understanding
D-BUS notifications to the point where I can write it with my eyes
closed. :)

Anyhow, this code is only available in the
`billreminder-0.3 <http://billreminder.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/billreminder/branches/billreminder-0.3/>`__
branch. That is where you’ll also find my generic Gtk.TreeView code. I
hope to be able to release this fairly soon… It will all depend on how
long the itch will last! :)
