For the `second <http://l10n.gnome.org/languages/pt_BR>`__ release cycle
in a row, I’m pleased to announce that GNOME will be **100%**\ \*
available in **Brazilian Portuguese**! This feat shows again how the
collaborative effort between the Ubuntu and GNOME Brazilian translation
teams! Since all translations were submitted and aproved by the GNOME
commiters (thank you **Leonardo**, **Raphel** and **Jonh**!) first,
every GNU/Linux distribution will be able to take advantage of effort!
If this doesn’t represent the true meaning of cooperation and
collaborative work, I don’t know what else does!

I hope to also announce fairly soon that `XFCE <http://www.xfce.org/>`__
will also be 100% translated into Brazilian Portuguese
(`Openbox <http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/Main_Page>`__ already
is), yet another collaborative effort which I’m proud to have initiated.
