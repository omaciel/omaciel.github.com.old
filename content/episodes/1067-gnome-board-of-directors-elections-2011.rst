I can’t believe it’s been this long already, but it is time for yet
another **Board of Directors Election**! Having had the opportunity to
serve on the Board for these last 12 months, I want to encourage anyone
who have the time and interest to improve the GNOME project to run for
one of the seven spots on the Board of Directors! For more information
on this, please read the official announcement
`here <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnome.foundation.announce/464>`__!
A few important dates to keep in mind:

-  **2011-05-22**: List of candidates closed
-  **2011-05-29**: Voting Begins
-  **2011-06-12**: Voting Ends
-  **2011-06-21**: Challenges End

**UPDATE**: The picture displayed here is not in any shape or form a
hint, indication, or suggestion of who one should vote for in any
election, period! If you, however, feel strongly encouraged/compelled to
do what pictures may suggest, please let me know as I will put a picture
of what kind of gifts you can then be compelled to buy me for my
birthday! :)
