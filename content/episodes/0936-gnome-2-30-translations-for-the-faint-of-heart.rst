With the **GNOME 2.30** release just around the corner, translators are
feverishly working hard to get the desktop completely translated into a
multitude of different languages! But unless you’re comfortable building
the application you’re trying to translate on your own (or perhaps the
entire desktop), you’re pretty much doing what I call “blind
translations.”

The good news is that you don’t have to do any compiling to play with
the very latest GNOME applications! Just download the `GNOME Developer
Kit <http://www.rpath.org/web/project/gnome/>`__ and start translating
knowing that you can actually see what you’re translating!

Borrowing from a previous post I wrote, just what is the GNOME Developer
Kit? It is a **continuous** build of GNOME packages all bundled up into
a distribution (in this case, `Foresight
Linux <http://www.foresightlinux.org/>`__) and distributed in a few
different formats that you can either install or run in a virtual
environmen.

So if youâ€™re a **translator** or writing docs, imagine being able to
see the application youâ€™re trying to translate running right in front
of you! As the GNOME Developerâ€™s Kit already comes with a lot of tools
such as **gettext**, **intltool** and **poEdit**, you got your work cut
out for you!

So don’t just sit there! Go download your **GNOME Developer Kit** today!
