Google announced today their new tool Sidebar, “\ *a panel on your
desktop which provides convenient, one-glance access to all sorts of
personalized information.*" It looks nice but I won’t be able to try it
out since they didn’t bother to create a Linux version! You’d think that
at least Google would have considered the open source community. This
really blows but I’ll survive.
