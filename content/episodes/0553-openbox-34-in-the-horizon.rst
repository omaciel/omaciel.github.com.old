I was extremely pleased/amazed when I read the change log with the
modifications, new features, and bugs fixed in the up and coming new
version for Openbox! The
`list <http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/Openbox:Changelog>`__ is too
big to mention here, but take my word for it: it is amazing!

You can already get
`packages <http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/Openbox:Download>`__ for
**Ubuntu Feisty**, **Debian**, **Arch Linux**, and Slackware. If you’re
running **Foresight Linux** and want to try (unofficial for now) it,
drop me a line.

Worth of mentioning are the three new sessions that will allow you to
run Openbox as the default windows manager for GNOME or KDE (if you have
them installed), or as I do at work: straight up! But, the best part is
that you can now have all your favorite startup applications (via a
script) saved in a autostart.sh file inside your $HOME/.config/openbox
directory. I used to change the openbox.desktop file under the
../xsessions directory so to call a previously created startup script.
The problem with that was that if you have multiple users, they would
all get the same exact set of applications started by default.

The other thing I thought worth of mentioning was this little comment on
their notes:

    During the development cycle for Openbox 3.4, we fixed and closed
    every bug listed in the bug tracker from previous versions.
    `Link <http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/Help:Upgrading_to_3.4>`__

Wow!!! That is amazing!!! Kudos to all involved in the process! I may
add that Openbox 3.4 will also be completely translated to Brazilian
Portuguese, thanks to the initial effort by **Crimeboy** and a few
touches by yours trully! ;) I’ve been running it for 4 days now and am
extremely impressed with the speed!

Finally, I’ve also gotten
`ObConf <http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/ObConf:About>`__ running
but it has a nasty bug that will mangle up your configuration files,
making it hard for those who like to tweak it by hand. (bug
#\ `3155 <http://bugzilla.icculus.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3155>`__).
