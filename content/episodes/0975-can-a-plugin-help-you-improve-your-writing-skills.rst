My good friend `Vinny <http://awkward-silence.com/>`__ introduced me
toÂ \ `After the Deadline <http://afterthedeadline.com/>`__, aÂ nifty
**WordPress** and **Firefox** plugin that promises to “ï»¿help you write
better by adding spell, style, and grammar checking to web
applications.”

As some of you know I have been on a writing rampage these last few
weeks, and as in everything that I ever do, I try my best to write
concise, clear and well written articles. For someone who didn’t start
learning (i.e. reading, writing and speaking) the American English
language until I was 17 years old, I feel that I’ve done a decent job
here on my blog, but one can never be too careful.

The list of features thatÂ provided out of the box is quite impressive:

-  Spell checking that uses artificial intelligence to make
   recommendations based on the context;
-  Detection of common misused words, for those times when your brain
   gets ahead of you and you type one word, when you really meant
   another;
-  Style checker to help you simplify complex phrases, avoid redundancy,
   passive voice, clichÃ©s and bias language;
-  Extensive grammar checker;

and all of these will also be explained to you, so that you not only fix
your mistakes, but learn from them too!

So I hoped to their web page and followed the instructions on how to add
this plugin to an existing WordPress blog, and tried it by writing this
post. I was glad to see that only 3 suggestions showed up when I clicked
the proofreading button, reinforcing my belief that I am doing a decent
job after all. The advantage for the corrections were all pretty clear
and the added explanation was a welcome bonus!

Even though I have only used this plugin for less than 30 minutes, I can
totally see it becoming a favorite tool for my day-to-day use. If you’re
interested in trying it or would like to get more information about it,
I highly recommend that you watch their screen cast as well as read the
`documentation <http://en.support.wordpress.com/proofreading/>`__
specific to WordPress.
