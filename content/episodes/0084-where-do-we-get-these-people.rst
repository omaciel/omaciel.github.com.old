While typing my last post I was interrupted by a so-called “.Net
Developer who just earned his PMP.” He’s been “featured” here before for
asking “very intelligent questions.” =) This time he told me he had just
bundled some application and given to a DBA to run it when they received
an error message: **Oracle[blah blah blah].dll not found**!!!

    "So this program you wrote is trying to connect to an Oracle
    database?", I asked.
    “Yes”.
    “And what technology are you using to connect?”
    “Huh???”
    “Are you using ODP.NET?”
    “HUH???”
    “Are you using Oracle Data Provider for .NET?”
    “Yes.”
    “Does the client also have it OR have you included it with your
    application?”
    “HUH???”

And on and on it goes…
