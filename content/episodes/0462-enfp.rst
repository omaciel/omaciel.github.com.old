My good friend SuperToadman pointed me to this online `Myer-Briggs Test
For Programmers <http://eggheadcafe.com/articles/mb/default.asp>`__
today and I was amazed at how accurate the results came out!!! The test
came very, very close to describe how I see myself. Come to think of it,
I can see how this shaped my decisions in life.

Anyhow, here’s some more background on ENFP “personalities”… Anyone who
knows me personally agree/disagree with it?
