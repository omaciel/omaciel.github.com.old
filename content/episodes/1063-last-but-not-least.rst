With all the blog posts, newsfeeds and social media channels abuzz with
the latest and greatest releases these past 2 days I just wanted to take
the time to add one more thank you note:

**Thank You** all **developers**, **translators**, **document writers**,
**graphic designers**, **bug trackers**, **release engineers** and
**everyone else** involved in working directly with the **upstream
projects** and for making all of the moving pieces that compose a Linux
distribution readily available for anyone to use! There are just too
many to mention, but if you spent the last few months working your butt
off on an upstream project, **I salute you**!
