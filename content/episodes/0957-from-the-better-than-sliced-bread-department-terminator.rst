From the “better than sliced bread” department, I bring you
**Terminator**! No, not that
`terminator <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator>`__. This
`Terminator <http://bit.ly/aziWwM>`__:

    “\ **Terminator** is a program that allows users to set up flexible
    arrangements of GNOME terminals. It is aimed at those who normally
    arrange lots of terminals near each other, but don’t want to use a
    frame based window manager.”

Basically, think about opening a single terminal (console) window and
then splitting it down the middle (vertically) to get now two separate
and independent terminals… and then splitting the left terminal
horizontally, giving you now three terminals… and then… well, you
probably get the drift by now.

But why would you want to split your terminal like this? I can’t speak
for everyone but splitting the terminal allows me to be more productive
at work and at home, as I can perform several tasks in one single window
and see all of them at the same time. For instance, I can package
software in one console (upper left), watch my system’s resource (upper
right) on another, and keep up with what’s happening on IRC (lower) at
the same time!

Wouldn’t you prefer **tabs instead**? Well, how about **both**?
Terminator can handle both tabs and splits, which can be very useful
when you’re working on multiple things that require some level of
separation. For instance, you could have several terminals in one tab,
and a whole bunch of other terminals on a second tab dedicated to some
other activity.

At work I usually have several ssh connections open to several different
servers, running some `Fabric <http://bit.ly/dor4KJ>`__ scripts in one
terminal while watching a log or two on other terminals. Sometimes I
want to run the same exact command interactively on several different
servers. For these scenarios a very nifty trick is the grouping feature
which allows you send the same text typed in one terminal to a group of
terminals.

For someone who is so addicted to custom keyboard shortcuts as I am,
Terminator offers a huge number of actions that can be performed without
having to move your hands away from the keyboard. I don’t know about
you, but the less I have to use the mouse, the more productive I am!
