So yesterday I finally managed to get a hold of another HP TC1100 and
bring it with me to the `MySQL Meetup <http://mysql.meetup.com/23/>`__
last night. There were many interesting things during our first ever
“show & tell” session, which shall get mentioned on a later post, but
all I really wanted to do was to install Ubuntu onto the TabletPC and
try to get everything working.

The new and extremelly easy to follow 5-step installation process was
readly approved by all, and in approximately 15 minutes I had a complete
system, minus support for the stylus pen… yet. ;) I can proudly say that
the built-in wireless card worked like a charm though!

Following the advices I received, either via comments or email, I
proceeded to install the wacom-tools package, rebooted and… I had a
working stylus!!! It cannot get any easier than that!

Tonight I will try to get the stylus to actually write stuff (right now
it works as a pointing device only) and get the video/screen rotation to
work. I have some really great links
(`1 <http://groundstate.ca/TC1100>`__,
`2 <http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/index.php/howto/inputdev>`__) that
should at least keep me busy for a while. I will also post some more
pictures to show off any progress I make.
