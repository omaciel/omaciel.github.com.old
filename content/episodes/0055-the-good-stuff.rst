Wow!!! It is amazing how great this whole week has been for me so far at
work! Been churning out code for my very simple data to xml application
and sometimes (the horror) I don’t even want to go home so I won’t
interrupt the grooviness! Tomorrow I’m scheduled to give a live demo to
the rest of the group! I’m ready to blow them off their socks! For such
a simple and small program, I think I’ve done a pretty good job at
making it usefull and stable! It’s almost quitting time and I’m already
looking forward to tomorrow… ;)

Also had my meeting with the VP this afternoon… Not as exciting as I
expected to be… :-

On other news, played some `E.T. <http://www.enemy-territory.com>`__
with
`Vinny <http://www.supertoadman.com/cs/blogs/supertoadman/default.aspx>`__
last night… Fun as always!
