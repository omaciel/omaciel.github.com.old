Funny `write
up <http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2005/07/16/which_evil_nation_state_are_you_similes_for_microsoft_yahoo_and_google.html>`__
comparing the 3 most used web search engines to world countries:

[snip]

    **Microsoft is Germany**. They did some pretty evil things a while
    back but you don’t remember the details, you just know that you
    really hate them…

[snip]

    **Yahoo is Japan**. It had an economic crisis that almost destroyed
    it and it plays too nice with all of the other evil empires,
    supporting the most evil endeavors…

[snip]

    **Google is the United States**. It has never seen trouble on home
    turf. It is arrogant and loved by the elite.

I wonder what search engine Brazil would be???
