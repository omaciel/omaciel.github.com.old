Yesterday I completed my first year of work at this NYC departmental
agency… That’s 365 days of 2-3 hours commute… approximately $11 parking,
$10.50 tolls daily… 365 days having to buy this watered down,
taste-like-piss liquid they insist in calling coffee… 365 days of being
constantly reminded (directly and indirectly) that I don’t belong here
and am “just a consultant” with no rights or say in anything… and worse
of all, 365 days of getting home very tired and not being able to enjoy
the few hours I have (from around 7pm to 10pm) with my young daughter
and wife!

A big thanks goes to all those
`assholes <http://www.princeton.edu/~rvdb/JAVA/election2004/>`__ who
chose to elect our current president for yet another 4-years term! I
wonder if you are all enjoying listening to the daily reports of our
troops dying in a foreign land for a stupid *war over oil*\ … or if you
admired how *promptly* our government came to the rescue of all the
folks down in New Orleans… or if they feel good in seeing our economy
going down the gutter…

An they call America a “first world country.”
