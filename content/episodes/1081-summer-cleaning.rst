After debating for the last couple of months about re-organizing my two
blogs into a more intuitive (perhaps logical even?) format, I finally
took advantage of some down time over the weekend and made a few
changes. From now on, `www.ogmaciel.com <http://www.ogmaciel.com>`__
will no longer be my blog written in **English**, but instead will serve
as a “business card/window” into my world. My “English” blog is now
hosted on `en.ogmaciel.com <http://en.ogmaciel.com>`__ and my
“\ **Brazilian Portuguese**" blog lives on
`pt.ogmaciel.com <http://pt.ogmaciel.com>`__.

If you happen to maintain one of the blog aggregators (aka “planets”) I
kindly ask you to update my feed as follows:

-  `Journal of an Open Source <http://en.ogmaciel.com>`__ (**English**):
    `http://feeds.feedburner.com/JournalOfAnOpenSourcee <http://feeds.feedburner.com/JournalOfAnOpenSourcee>`__
-  `Open Source Guy <http://pt.ogmaciel.com>`__ (**Brazilian
   Portuguese**): \ `http://feeds.feedburner.com/OpenSourceGuyPosts <http://feeds.feedburner.com/OpenSourceGuyPosts>`__

One more thing I did over the weekend was to change my email signature
to no longer include “\ **GNOME Board of Directors**\ ”. Sometimes I
catch myself remembering that wasn’t too ago that I dreamed of joining
the Board and making a difference… I feel that I learned a lot about the
**GNOME** project as a whole, as well as about a lot of the people
behind it. I didn’t fulfill all of the things I wanted to accomplish
(work, real life and a bit of inexperience got on the way of things some
times) but I sure hope that people will appreciate the things I did get
done. In the end I chose not to run for re-election because the time is
just not right for me, but I don’t rule out running again in the near
future.

Anyhow, **update your feeds** and best of luck to the new **GNOME Board
of Directors**!
