I was very pleased when my good friend **Pete** asked me to be a
contributor to his new project,
`GeekDeck <http://geekdeck.wordpress.com/>`__, “a new zine/blog thingy
that (he is) hoping will wet your appetite for all things geek.” Pete
and I have been friends for some time already and find his projects very
stimulating and fun. Whoever hasn’t watched his old web show
`Prog8ox <http://www.progbox.co.uk/site/>`__ doesn’t missed out big
time!

As Pete wanted to publish something fairly quick and gave us all a very
tight schedule (he’s a slave driver I tell you), and we went into code
release mode at work, I didn’t manage to write my article about
GNU/Linux Appliances and Cloud Computing. Instead, I decided to start a
regular column called “\ **Cherry Picks of the Month**\ ”, where I
intend to write about cool applications and write up a super mini review
about them. Take a look at the first edition
`here <http://geekdeck.wordpress.com/2009/04/13/review-cherry-picks-of-the-month/>`__
and do send me any application you may want me to review or pimp. As
long as I can get my hands on the source code (don’t give me packages,
etc as I do not run any of the popular distros out there) I’ll take it
for a whirl.

If you want to read my post about GNU/Linux Appliances don’t fret as I
am still considering to write it for an upcoming issue of GeekDeck. I
will also have some new reviews for some awesome web apps that will
knock your translation (*cough* `Transifex <http://transifex.org/>`__
*cough*) socks off, and… what? You’re not a cool translator like *moi*?
No worries, I will also have appliance building and personal financing
in the mix so you don’t feel left out.
