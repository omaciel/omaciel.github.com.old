I have just received the news from `Walter
Cruz <http://devlog.waltercruz.com/>`__ that he chose the Brazilian
Portuguese version of my blog as one of his favorites for this year’s
`Blog Day 2007 <http://www.blogday.org/>`__! I was very pleased and
honored for being selected by such a great guy! ;)

So I’ll join in the fun and will announce a couple of my favorite
Brazilian blogs. Just a little display that Brazilians have much more to
offer than Carnaval, beautifull women, and soccer players:

#. `Blog AurÃƒÂ©lio Verde <http://aurelio.wordpress.com/>`__: I really
   enjoy AurÃƒÂ©lio’s laid back style and stories!
#. `Fudeblog <http://zyakannazio.eti.br/fudeblog/>`__: Yet another
   diverse and fun blog by CÃƒÂ©sar Cardoso!
#. `Simples IdÃƒÂ©ias, por Nando
   Vieira <http://simplesideias.com.br/>`__ is one of my favorite blogs
   to catch up on programming tips, with the right amount of tips and
   code.
#. `Nerdson nÃƒÂ£o vai ÃƒÂ  escola <http://www.nerdson.com/blog/>`__ is
   a Brazilian comic strip that always makes me laugh!
#. `SÃƒÂ©rgio Rafael Lemke <http://sergiorafael.wordpress.com/>`__'s
   blog has served as a valuable reference for those times someone asks
   me how to get Ubuntu to perform tricks !

Unfortunately I don’t know their emails right off the top of my head
(you’re supposed to let them know about your selection, but I’m sure
they’ll “bump” into this post somehow. :)
