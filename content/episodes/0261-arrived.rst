Took me 3 1/2 hours to drive from Jersey to Boston…Ã‚Â  Arrived around
1:30pm at the nearby Ramada Inn.Ã‚Â  Dropped off my luggage at my roon
(which has a terrible smell of moth balls!!!) and immediately took a cab
down to South Boston.Ã‚Â  My cab driver got lost so it took us 45
minutes to get there!Ã‚Â  Grabbed my badge and walked around.Ã‚Â 
Inside, pure chaos as a lot of the organizers tried to get their stuff
ready for tomorrow.

The Ubuntu booth doesn’t have anything yet besides 2 tall chairs and
empty tables.Ã‚Â  Tomorrow I’m bringing in the hardware and some free
goodies as well.Ã‚Â  Spent some more time walking around the piles of
empty boxes and containers spread all over the floor…Ã‚Â  Tried in vain
to capture some more images of the mad house but my phone cam wasn’t up
to the task.

Took another cab down to the piers where 2 people told me I’d find the
“No Name” restaurant.Ã‚Â  I don’t really enjoy eating by myself but had
no choice.Ã‚Â  A bowl of seafood chowder and a Sam Adams later I was
ready to go back to my room.Ã‚Â  found out there was free wifi access…
woot!Ã‚Â  I think I’m going to turn in early tonight… maybe is the fumes
from the moth balls…

PS:Ã‚Â  I’m still looking for volunteers to man the booth so feel free
to drop me a line.
