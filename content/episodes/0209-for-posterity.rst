**Disclaimer**: I am definitely not a show off and am only posting this
here so I can always look back and remember the responsibility I have
voluntarily accepted upon me: To be an Ubuntu Member!

--------------

Here is the report of todays Community Council Meeting

-  **General Items**

-  Bhuvan suggested that the RSS feed of the wiki RecentChanges page
   should be advertized more. This is going to happen.
-  The options for reducing the stress on the CC meetings by (partially)
   delegating membership approvals have been discussed. There was
   general consensus that Option C of the plans of Mark Shuttleworth is
   the best way forward. This will be implemented as soon as possible.

-  **LoCo Teams**

-  The Japanese locoteam introduced itself, Jun Kobayashi and Hiroyuki
   Ikezoe reported their plans and their achievements. The main
   achievement is a localized version of the Ubuntu CD. Their good work
   will be merged with Ubuntu to make Ubuntu rock Japan.

-  **New Community Members**

-  After months of waiting and not being able to attend the meetings,
   Jonathan Jesse and Robert Stoffers have joined the Ubuntu community.
   Their work for the documentation team has been absolutely teriffic.
-  **Og Maciel** has been advocating Ubuntu and translating into
   Brazilian Portuguese; he also created planeta Ubuntu brasil. He has
   been welcomed aboard the Ubuntu ship.
-  Ryan Lortie is upstream developer for gnome-applets and will be an
   Ubuntu developer soon, Ryan now also is Ubuntu member.
-  Hubert FiguiÃƒÂ¨re has done good work for digital photography in
   Ubuntu and has joined the members.
-  Jonathan Carter is deploying Ubuntu on schools in ZA and is part of
   the Edubuntu team. He is now also part of the ever growing list of
   members.
-  Two members of the Japanese team, Jun Kobayashi and Hiroyuki Ikezoe
   have done great work on Japanese localization and promotion. They now
   also joined the ubuntu members family

**Notes:**

-  The emphasis is all mine… ;)
-  It was stated that I created Planeta Ubuntu Brasil. Even though I did
   come up with the idea and got the project going, it was only due to
   the collaborative effort of a few Brazilian users that the web site
   came to be! I am very proud of what we have accomplished together and
   could never take credit for the entire enterprise! I have contacted
   the author of the `original
   post <http://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2005-November/012877.html>`__
   and asked him to make the proper changes!

**Update**: It has been fixed…

[snip]”Seems like I messed up my logs here. Og Maciel and Mario Meyer
have both done good work in the Brazil team, both have been welcomed
aboard the Ubuntu ship. Mario Meyer is the person who wrote PHPlanet,
which powers the brasilian planet.”[/snip]
