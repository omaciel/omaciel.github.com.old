Last night I decided to work on my plan of racking up World of Warcraft
hours in order to beef up my character but since my friend Vinny was
busy with his own quests, I decided to try my newly learned skill:
fishing! As stupid as this may sound, I never thought that fishing in a
game could be so… relaxing! I switched my character’s sword for a
fishing pole and spent a good 15 minutes casting the line and watching
the bobber. There was nobody around and I completely lost track of time…
Soon enough I had 4 mackerels in my bag. That’s when I noticed some
“clipping” sounds and my vital signal decreasing: a couple of
crab-looking creatures came from behind me and started attacking me! It
took me several seconds to realize what had just happened and even then
my brain was still in fishing mode. I attempted to fend the creatures
off with the fishing pole (I completely forgot to switch back to my
sword) but ended up minced to pieces. The good thing was that I was able
to return to the same spot, kill the evil creatures and am planning on
using my also new skill of cooking to eat my mackerels! I wonder if
they’ll spoil and start to smell???
