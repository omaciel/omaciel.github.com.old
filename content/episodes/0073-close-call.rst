Not in a blogging mood today… Got home last night at **9:30pm(!!!)** and
checked my messages: 1 new message! An old girl-friend crying and
mumbbling about her sister (also an old good friend) having an accident…
broken up telephone number to call back (she must have called from a
cell phone… had to rewind message 2 times… Call number and a guy
answers… After introductions (“Hi, I’m an old friend of such and such…”)
learn that the sister had apparently “thrown herself out the window of
her second floor apartment.” Find out which hospital she is and try to
call… “Vising hours are over!” Shortly after a friend of the girl calls
me and tells me a bit more info… Terrible accident due to alcohol… Fell
off the fire exit ladder… broke 3rd vertebrae… just had surgery… removed
a rib and used to to replace vertebrae(????)… Today I didn’t go to work
and went early to the hospital. Spent 3 1/2 hours with my friend, trying
to cheer her up and just plainly keep her company. Later in the morning
an aunt showed up and stayed untill I left.

I’ve known this girl for almost 10 years but had not seen or heard of
her for the last 8. About 1 1/2 months ago I learned that she was back
in town (not knowing she was out of town for a couple of years) and
decided to get a hold of her. A week later took her out with my family
for a very casual dinner. It felt as if we had never been “disconnected”
for 8 years and our conversations picked up right at the point where we
had left off. Saturday night she had dinner at my house, where I amazed
her with one of my 2 laptops running Ubuntu linux while fixing her
Windows XP laptop. Sunday morning she calls me to give her some
information on installing Office. Sunday evening she apparently went on
a “drinking spree” culminating with her “forced landing.”

Last time I heard of her today she had somewhat feelings on her
legs/toes… She’s only 22 years old…
