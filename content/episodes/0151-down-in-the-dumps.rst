Once again, I see my chance of relocating to Chapel Hill, NC crumble
down at the last second… This time around the prospect was much better
than the previous one: same compensation as I have now at a fast-paced
software development company. I even had all the required skills! What
really ticks me is that after the initial phone blitz from the recruiter
he just left me hanging for 3 days… until I emailed him to pretty much
say “throw me a friggin’ bone here!” Turns out, he replied, that I
didn’t have enough experience working for a software development
company. Never mind they develop software for pharmaceutical companies
and that I have a B.S. in Biochemistry and over 7 years of experience
working in the pharmaceutical field!!! Had I not emailed him I’d still
be waiting for an answer…
