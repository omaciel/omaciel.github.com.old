|image0|\ It’s been a while since I actually blogged or wrote much that
wasn’t work related… so here’s a list, in no particular order, of what I
have been doing these days for those who were wondering what had
happened to me:

I have been asked to **step into a new role at work**, and for the last
2-3 months I have been acting as the **team lead** (no job title change
yet). As such, my day to day routine has changed dramatically, and I now
spend most of my time planning, organizing and building up our team.

Part of building our team involves spending some time getting to know my
**teammates who are spread across 3 different countries and timezones**.
We have been using **Google Hangout** for our weekly status meetings and
the ability to not only hear but see one another has definitely changed
for the better how we interact with each other. Every and single one of
my teammates are awesome and bring something unique and special to the
team!

I also **started working full time from home** and no longer have to do
the 50 miles/day commute to the office. I’ve had the opportunity to work
remotely before (twice a week) and I’m very comfortable with the idea.
As a matter of fact, I feel that I work harder and longer hours when I’m
home, as there are no cues to tell me to take breaks or that I have to
go home. Since `Red Hat <http://www.redhat.com/>`__ seems to have been
designed with a distributed/spread work force, there are quite a lot of
people who work remotely and all interaction is done via irc/email.

My project is actually a community driven, open project:
`Katello <http://katello.org/>`__. Being able to tell people what I work
on and show them the source code is something I find priceless! For the
first time in my life I work for a company where “upstream” belongs to
the community. 

I have also started learning both `Clojure <http://clojure.org/>`__ and
`Emacs <http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs>`__ for work. Having spent the
last 5-6 years as a “\ **Python** guy” and **Vim** user, this has been
by far the most radical change I’ve had to do so far. After going as far
as creating an alias that will start **emacs -nw** whenever I type vim
in a console, I am starting to really enjoy the emacs + clojure
experience. I still press ESC a lot (old habits are hard to change)
though :)

Been reading a lot! When I’m not reading a book, I’m catching up with
articles and news from several different sources. I use a combination of
`Zite <http://www.zite.com/>`__, `Flipboard <http://flipboard.com/>`__
and a few digital magazines (**`Wired <http://wired.com/>`__**,
`Smithsonian <http://www.smithsonian.com/>`__, `The
Week <http://theweek.com/>`__) for my daily news dose and
`Instapaper <http://www.instapaper.com/>`__ for those articles I want to
read at a later time. My **iPad** has become a constant and
reliable companion. Some of the books I’ve read:

-  `Neuromancer <http://www.amazon.com/Neuromancer-William-Gibson/dp/0441012035/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1342401948&sr=8-1&keywords=neuromancer>`__

I also listen to a lot of music now that I can crank music really loud
without annoying a co-worker, so
**`Pandora <http://www.pandora.com>`__**,
**`Grooveshark <http://grooveshark.com/#!/ogmaciel>`__** and **`Radio
Paradise <http://www.radioparadise.com/>`__** have been a constant
presence.

**I switched distros**!!! There, I said it! After **6 years** running
`Foresight Linux <http://foresightlinux.org>`__ exclusively, I have now
been running `Fedora 17 <http://fedoraproject.org/>`__ on all of my
systems. The choice was completely work related and had nothing to do
with the current state of Foresight, its community or future (which I
can say is in very good hands by the way). Does that mean that my
involvement with Foresight will be affected? The answer, sadly, is yes.
My focus right now is fully concentrated on work and family and I don’t
think I will have the time or stamina to dedicate the amount of time
that running a GNU/Linux distribution requires.

Due to work and commitments to my family, my involvement with my pet
projects, translations and the **GNOME Membership Committee** has
reached a stagnant point. Don’t be surprised if I “retire” from some of
my activities and start watching from the sidelines.

Speaking of projects, I am still running my **Brazilian
Portuguese**-only `podcast <http://castalio.info>`__, publishing a new
episode every other week (**40 episodes** and counting)! This is
something I’m totally committed to and even with my busy schedule I
still find time to enjoy doing the podcast.

I’m also contemplating **writing one or two books** in collaboration
with a good friend, but more on that later.

Well, this is it for now! 2012 has proven to be a very busy yet
fulfilling year for my entire family so far and several new and exciting
changes are coming down the pipe.
