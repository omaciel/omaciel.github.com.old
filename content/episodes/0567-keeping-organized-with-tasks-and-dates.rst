After talking to a few other guys about
`Openbox <http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/Main_Page>`__ and what
other applications one can use to get the best experience from a blazing
fast windows manager, I remembered the other two programs I use to keep
myself organized, both at home and at work: **Dates** and **Tasks**.

`Tasks <http://pimlico-project.org/tasks.html>`__ is basically a ToDo
list that allows me to easily and quickly keep track of my weekly tasks,
prioritizing each item as I see fit. It doesn’t have a lot of bells and
whistles and I believe that is one of the reasons I chose it. If I were
to make a few suggestions, I’d add tooltips to each item, as well as the
ability to launch a web page if items have an URL assigned to it.

Its counter-part is `Dates <http://pimlico-project.org/dates.html>`__, a
scheduling tool for the desktop. It too is faily simple to use and it
allows me to keep track of meetings and important events. Once again, if
I were to make a constructive comment, it would be too add a
notification/reminder service to it, in case you’re off doing something
else… like watching the replay of Milan and Liverpool for instance. :)

It would also be nice to sync up these two programs, and I think that is
what `Sync <http://pimlico-project.org/sync.html>`__ will do.

By the way, if you’re wondering like
`LaserJock <http://laserjock.us/>`__ what is the panel bar I’m using
(bottom of the screen), that is
`PyPanel <http://pypanel.sourceforge.net/>`__. The Openbox theme is
`Ubuntu
Studio <http://www.box-look.org/content/show.php/ubuntustudio?content=59671>`__
and the wallpaper is from DevianArt (I couldn’t find it to link). And
this post was written using
`Drivel <http://www.dropline.net/drivel/>`__. ;)
