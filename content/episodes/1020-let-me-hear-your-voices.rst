This weekend I’ll be attending my first `Boston
Summit <http://live.gnome.org/Boston2010>`__, courtesy of the\ `GNOME
Travel Committee <http://live.gnome.org/Travel>`__! It will also be my
very first time meeting my fellow members of the **GNOME Foundation
Board of Directors**, which makes me very excited!

I wanted to ask you, readers of my blog, what kind of questions would
you like me to ask on your behalf? Do you have any constructive comments
or feedback for us? What are the areas you feel that we should invest
more of our resources on and which ones should we spend less?

I’m also very interested to hear from other projects out there (Hi
**KDE, XFCE, LXDE, Openbox** et all!) how can we work better together
and improve our relationship?

Mind you, these are my questions alone and represent some of my personal
goals if I were ever elected to the Board. My ultimate goal is to hear
everyone’s opinion and start discussions with the Board this weekend.

I look forward to hearing back from you!
