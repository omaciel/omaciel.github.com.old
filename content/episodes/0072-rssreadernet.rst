Been spending some time using the
`RSS.NET <http://www.rssdotnet.com/>`__ library (*"RSS.NET is an
open-source .NET class library for RSS feeds. It provides a reusable
object model for parsing and writing RSS feeds. It is fully compatible
with RSS versions 0.90, 0.91, 0.92, and 2.0.1, implementing all
constructs."* and decided to create my own Rss reader. It still has a
long way to go but it is in a semi-usefull state. I know there’s a
million rss readers out there but if anyone is interested in working on
this with me just drop me a line.
