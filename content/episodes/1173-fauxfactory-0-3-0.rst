Took some time from my vacation and released **FauxFactory 0.3.0** to
make it **Python 3** compatible and to add a new **generate\_utf8**
method (plus some nice tweaks and code clean up).

As always, the package is available on
`Pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fauxfactory/>`__ and can be
installed via **pip install fauxfactory**.

If you have any constructive feedback, suggestions, or file a bug report
or feature request, please use the
