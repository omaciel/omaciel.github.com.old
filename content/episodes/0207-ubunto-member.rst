Just like a teenager who’s about to get his driver’s license for the
first time, I was as nervous as one can be early this morning (14:00
UTC), while attending my first `Ubuntu
Council <https://launchpad.net/people/communitycouncil>`__ meeting. One
of the subjects to be discussed was my possible membership to the
`Ubuntu Members Team <https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntumembers>`__.
Topic after topic were brought up and dealt with… and as the minutes
passed on by, I could barely remain calm… I was afraid I’d choke during
my presentation and not say anything useful, but then… a huge calm came
over me… and I spoke! With passion! With conviction!

When the smoke cleared and all the dust settled (and after I was dragged
off the stage, gagged and tied up so to shut my mouth), I was informed
that I had been granted the membership! It was a very exciting moment
for me and it touched me to hear the type of compliments I received for
my involvement so far!

Just as any “award” show, one has to finish it off with a “thank you”
note… so, in no particular order…

Thank you:

-  sh
-  rbelem
-  segfault
-  MarioMeyer
-  Seveas

Specially, my wife and daughter for putting up with this husband/father
who spends way too much time glued to the PC… and takes every
opportunity to teach them that Open Source is the way to go!

… and everyone who’s supported me these last months and the members of
the council for seeing the potential I believe I have to offer to the
community! My heartfelt eternal gratitude!
