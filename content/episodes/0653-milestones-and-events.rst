Quick post to mention a couple of personal milestones and events:

-  Today is my 1-year anniversary at `rPath <http://www.rpath.org>`__.
   It also marks 1 year since I stopped doing work with **VB.NET/C#**
   and **PL/SQL** and embarked in a brand new world of **Python**, and
   web-by programming… There is not a day that I don’t learn something
   new!
-  Sept. 29th marked 1 year since I left **New Jersey** for **North
   Carolina**! Besides the advantages of working with such a smart bunch
   (see above), I now get to spend quality time with my wife and two
   daughters. I get to see them grow and learn, and **that** is
   priceless!
-  October 16th will be my **7th wedding anniversary**! Marrying
   Elizabeth was about the smartest thing I have ever done!
-  I will be attending this year’s `FOSSCamp
   2007 <http://www.fosscamp.org/HowToAttend>`__, together with my
   friend **Ken Vandine**. Looking forward to seeing **Jorge** and
   **Jono** again!
