Continuing with my new year’s resolution of working harder at the
translation and bug triage of Ubuntu Linux, I have finally removed
Windows XP from one of my PCs (the only one then running something other
than Linux) and installed Dapper Drake. …and as the saying goes, “a
picture is worth 1,000 words,” you can see below how I have prioritized
Ubuntu in my professional life:

-  Ubuntu Dapper (x86) running on a Pentium 4 (lower left side);
-  Ubuntu Breezy (x86\_64) running on an AMD 64 (lower right side);
-  Ubuntu Breezy (x86) running on my Laptop (IBM X40) (table top to the
   left);
-  Coffee mug (the biggie size me version) with Ubuntu logo (Thanks
   Toadman!).
