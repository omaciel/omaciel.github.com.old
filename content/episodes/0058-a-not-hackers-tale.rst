This is just too
`funny <http://www.jellyslab.com/~bteo/hacker.htm>`__!!! Not sure if it
really happened or not but my professional experience has proven me
wrong many times before! Hehehe… Read on…

*Something nice I read on www.stophiphop.de (got pointed there by a
comment on www.macguardians.de) is this nice story of a hacker:
`http://www.beast.mos-worlds.de/modules/new…php?storyid=184 <http://www.beast.mos-worlds.de/modules/new...php?storyid=184>`__\ `www.stophiphop.de <http://www.stophiphop.de>`__
(got pointed there by a comment on
`www.macguardians.de <http://www.macguardians.de>`__) is this nice story
of a hacker: http://www.beast.mos-worlds.de/modules/new…php?storyid=184
(site might be down, quite a lot of people are reading this).*

In case you don’t speak german (just as this hacker), I’ve tried a
little translation to english. I might have made some spelling errors,
but the original spelling wasn’t perfect either. The guy really said
“buy buy” in the german version. I’ve posted this on the forum on
`http://www.desertcombat.com <http://www.desertcombat.com>`__ before, so
if this looks familiar, might be the same. I’ve corrected some mistakes
and put the <> back to the right version (The DC forum does not support
them). All censoring was done by this particular forum here. Notice that
in germany we get DST earlier than in the US.

The story starts (I’m shortcutting here) with an [Please control your
cussing] insulting everyone on the IRC channel. Most people there
believed it was rather funny, but it got even more funny. For
information: The dangerous hacker is called bitchchecker and the one
being hacked and original author of the comments, who is talking here,
is known as Elch. 127.0.0.1 is always the IP-adress of the computer
you’re currently using, any request there will return to your computer.

    **bitchchecker**: the timing of my pc is right
    **bitchchecker**: i even have dst
    **bitchchecker**: you banned me
    **bitchchecker**: amit it you son of a bitch
    **hopperhunter \|afk**: LOL
    **hopperhunter \|afk**: shit you’re stupid, DST^^
    **bitchchecker**: shut your mouth WE HAVE DST!
    **bitchchecker**: for two weaks already
    **bitchchecker**: when you start your pc there is a message from windows that DST is applied.
    **elch**: You’re a real computer expert
    **bitchchecker**: shut up i hack you
    **elch**: ok, i’m quiet, hope you don’t show us how good a hacker you are ^^
    **bitchchecker**: tell me your network number man then you’re dead
    **elch**: Eh, it’s 129.0.0.1
    **elch**: or maybe 127.0.0.1v **elch**: yes exactly that’s it: 127.0.0.1 I’m waiting for you great attack
    **bitchchecker**: in five minutes your hard drive is deleted
    **elch**: Now I’m frightened
    **bitchchecker**: shut up you’ll be gone
    **bitchchecker**: i have a program where i enter your ip and you’re dead
    **bitchchecker**: say goodbye
    **elch**: to whom?
    **bitchchecker**: to you man
    **bitchchecker**: buy buy
    **elch**: I’m shivering thinking about such great Hack0rs like you
    \* bitchchecker (~java@euirc-61a2169c.dip.t-dialin.net) Quit (Ping timeout#)

What happened is clear: That guy entered his own IP-Adress in his mighty
Hack-Tool and crashed his own PC. This way, the attack on my PC was a
failure. I was already starting to think that I did not have to worry,
but a good hacker never calls it a day. Two minutes later he returned.

    **bitchchecker**: dude be happy my pc crashed otherwise you’d be gone
    **metanot**: lol
    **elch**: bitchchecker: Then try hacking me again… I still have the same IP: 127.0.0.1
    **bitchchecker**: you’re so stupid man
    **bitchchecker**: say buy buy
    **metanot**: ah, [Please control your cussing] off
    **bitchchecker**: buy buy elch
    \* bitchchecker (~java@euirc-b5cd558e.dip.t-dialin.net) Quit (Ping timeout#)

There was a tension in the room… Would he manage, after these two
failures, to crash my PC? I waited. Nothing happened. I felt relieve…
Six minutes passed by until he prepared the next wave of attack. Being a
Hacker, who usually cracks whole data centers, he knew what his problem
was now.

    **bitchchecker**: elch you son of a bitch
    **metanot**: bitchchecker how old are you?
    **elch**: What’s up bitchchecker?
    **bitchchecker**: you have a frie wal
    **bitchchecker**: fire wall
    **elch**: maybe, i don’t know
    **bitchchecker**: i’m 26
    **metanot**: such behaviour with 26?
    **elch**: how did you find out that I have a firewall?
    **metanot**: tststs this is not very nice missy
    **bitchchecker**: because your gay fire wall directed my turn off
    signal back to me
    **bitchchecker**: be a man turn that shit off
    **elch**: cool, didn’t know this was possible.
    **bitchchecker**: thn my virus destroys your pc man
    **metanot**: are you hacking yourselves?
    **elch**: yes bitchchecker is trying to hack me
    **metanot**: he bitchchecker if you’re a hacker you have to get
    around a firewall even i can do that
    **bitchchecker**: yes man i hack the elch but the sucker has a fire
    wall the
    **metanot**: what firewall do you have?
    **bitchchecker**: like a girl
    **metanot**: firewall is normal a normal hacker has to be able to
    get past it…you girl^^
    **he**: Bitch give yourself a jackson and chill you’re letting them
    provoce you and give those little girls new material all the time
    **bitchchecker**: turn the firewall off then i send you a virus
    [Please control your cussing]er
    **elch**: Noo
    **metanot**: he bitchchecker why turn it off, you should turn it off
    **bitchchecker**: you’re afraid
    **bitchchecker**: i don’t wanna hack like this if he hides like a
    girl behind a fire wall
    **bitchchecker**: elch turn off your shit wall!
    **metanot**: i wanted to say something about this, do you know the
    definition of hacking??? if he turns of the firewall that’s an
    invitation and that has nothing to do with hacking
    **bitchchecker**: shut up
    **metanot**: lol
    **bitchchecker**: my grandma surfs with fire wall
    **bitchchecker**: and you suckers think you’re cool and don’t dare
    going into the internet without a fire wall

He calls me girly and says only his grandma would use a firewall. I know
that elder people are much more intelligent then younger, but I couldn’t
let that rest. To see whether he really is a good hacker I lie and let
everything as it is. I don’t have a firewall at all, only my router.

    **elch**: bitchchecker, a collegue showed me how to turn the
    firewall off. Now you can try again
    **metanot**: bitchhacker can’t hack
    > nice play on words ^^
    **bitchchecker**: wort man
    **elch**: bitchchecker: I’m still waiting for your attack!
    **metanot**: how many times again he is no hacker
    **bitchchecker**: man do you want a virus
    **bitchchecker**: tell me your ip and it deletes your hard drive
    **metanot**: lol ne give it up i’m a hacker myself and i know how
    hackers behave and i can tell you 100.00% you’re no hacker..^^
    **elch**: 127.0.0.1
    **elch**: it’s easy
    **bitchchecker**: lolololol you so stupid man you’ll be gone
    **bitchchecker**: and are the first files being deleted
    **elch**: mom…
    **elch**: i’ll take a look

In panic I started the Windows Explorer, my heart beating faster. Had I
under-estimated him?

    **bitchchecker**: don’t need to rescue you can’t son of a bitch
    **elch**: that’s bad
    **bitchchecker**: elch you idiout your hard drive g: is deleted
    **elch**: yes, there’s nothing i can do about it
    **bitchchecker**: and in 20 seconds f: is gone

Yes, true, G: and F: were gone. Did I ever have them? Doesn’t matter, I
did not have time to think, I was scared. bitchchecker was comforting me
with a music tip.

    **bitchchecker**: tupac rules
    **bitchchecker**: elch you son of a bitch your f: is gone and e: too

Drive E:? Oh my god… All the games are there! And the vacation pictures!
I instantly take a look. Everything still there. But the hacker said it
was deleted….

Or isn’t it happening on my computer?

    **bitchchecker**: and d: is at 45% you idiot lolololol
    **he**: why doesn’t meta say anything
    **elch**: he’s probably rolling on the floor laughing
    > ^^
    **bitchchecker**: your d: is gone
    **he**: go on BITCH

The guy is good: My CD-drive is allegedly deleted! Bitchchecker turned
my ancient disk sucker into a burner! But how did he do this? I’ll have
to ask him. Some encourage him. He himself is giving advice how to avoid
the disaster on my hard drives.

    **bitchchecker**: elch man you’re so stupid never give your ip on
    the internet
    **bitchchecker**: i’m already at c: 30 percent

Should I tell him he’s not attacking my computer?

    \* bitchchecker (~java@euirc-9ff3c180.dip.t-dialin.net) Quit (Ping
    timeout#)

Too late… It’s 20:22 when we get the last message of our hacker with the
alias “bitchchecker”. We see that he has a “Ping timeout”. We haven’t
seen him since then… must be the Daylight Saving Time.
