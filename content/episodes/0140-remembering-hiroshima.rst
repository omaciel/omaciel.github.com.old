I can’t believe I forgot to blog about one of the biggest act of
cowardice in human history: This past Saturday, August 6th 2005 marked
60 years since the US dropped an atomic bomb (codenamed Little Boy) over
Hiroshima! In a matter of seconds, **complete generations** were
literally **wiped off** the face of the Earth and the Empire of Japan
brought down to their knees had no other choice but surrender during
WWII. Apparently, real footage and pictures of Hiroshima after the blast
had been censured in the US for many decades and we haven’t really
learned or heard the true effects that this act had on the entire
nation. Maybe if people had heard the true stories of people literally
melting down due to the extensive heat (and probably atomic radiation)
they had been exposed and the subsequent after effects and
mutation-related diseases and birth defects that most likely evolved
later on, we would have made August 6th a day of mourning and
remembrance of the day the human race decided to open Pandora’s Box!
