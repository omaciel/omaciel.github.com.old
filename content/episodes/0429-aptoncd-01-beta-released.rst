What is it?
===========

`APTonCD <http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/>`__ is a tool with a graphical
interface which allows you to create one or more CDs or DVDs (you choose
the type of media) with all of the packages you’ve downloaded via
APT-GET or APTITUDE, creating a removable repository that you can use on
other computers. APTonCD will also allow you to automatically create
media with all of your .deb packages located in one especific
repository, so that you can install them into your computers without the
need for an internet conection.

Features
========

With APTonCD you can:

-  Create media with all your downloaded packages;
-  Create media with all packages from an especific repository
-  Download all official Ubuntu repositories (main,restricted,universe
   and multiverse) into removable media (CD/DVD);
-  Perform backup/restore all packages installed via apt;
-  Install, with the same CD/DVD, the same programs into several
   different machines;
-  Upgrade softwares/packages for several different machines,
   downloading them only one time;
-  I’m sure you got the picture. ;) In any event, more features will be
   added shortly and your suggestions are welcome :).
