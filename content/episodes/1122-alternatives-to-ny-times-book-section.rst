The **NY Times**' restriction of 10 articles/month for non-subscribers,
online viewers means I won't be reading their **Books section** anymore.
It sort of became a good habit for me and something I look forward to on
Sunday mornings: as I drink my coffee and enjoy some peace and quietness
as the kids are still asleep, I enjoy catching up with the latest books
and reviews. This weekend ritual usually ends with a trip down to the
public library with the whole family. Both of my kids are already
checking out more books and movies than my wife and I together.

But back to this decision by the NY Times, I understand that a for
profit establishment wants to, well, make money, and there’s nothing
wrong with that for sure. But for this weekend, Books section only
reader the options don’t make a lot of sense: **pay $6 for the Sunday
edition** so I can read a small subset of it is a bit expensive, and I
am not very sure how much it costs to get the online version.
