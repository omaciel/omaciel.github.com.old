The second session titled “Building online communities”, or something
like that, drew in a considerable group of people who were mostly
interested in the social aspect of it. It was fairly interesting how the
problem people were complaning about could be moderated by something
like the Ubuntu Code of
Conduct\ ` <https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct>`__! Great session and
Luis\ ` <http://tieguy.org/>`__ had a great analogy as for how a
community should work like a well thrown party! :)
