I was pleasantly surprised to see (as far as I know) the very first
article written about `APTonCD <http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/>`__ on
last month’s issue (issue 95) of `Linux
Format <http://www.linuxformat.co.uk>`__, my favorite Linux magazine!

Back in August (or was it September?) of last year I learned that
**Rafael “CypherBIOS” ProenÃƒÂ§a** had started this project written in
Python that promised to deliver “a tool with a graphical interface which
allows you to create one or more CDs or DVDs (you choose the type of
media) with all of the packages you’ve downloaded via APT-GET or
APTITUDE, creating a removable repository that you can use on other
computers.” Back then I was still tinkering with the idea of porting my
`BillReminder <http://billreminder.sourceforge.net/>`__ from C# to
Python, just so that I could start learning the language. Rafael seemed
eager to have someone else take a look at his code and generously
offered me commit access to his SVN repository. My first task was to
clean up the code, add some (much needed) comments, and split up the
code into classes, as well as divide the glade files into more
organizable modules. I then proceeded to recruit some more people to
help out and was extremely lucky to have met **Laudeci “Pretto” de
Oliveira**, a developer who was searching for a good reason to take a
plunge into the open source development world! I must say that Laudeci
was the missing piece of the puzzle, and even though several other
developers left their contribution here and there, it was him who fueled
up the project and shifted things into a higher gear! Shortly after I
started my job at rPath and with the birth if my second daughter, my
participation in the project went from developer/supporter to
cheerleader! :)

If you’re looking for a cool project to get you started in the open
source world and want to learn some cool python skills along the way,
visit their web site and come hang out on #aptoncd at Freenode. You will
not be disappointed.
