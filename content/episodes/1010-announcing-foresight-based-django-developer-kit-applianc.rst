If you remember one of my last
`posts <http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1187>`__, I wanted to eventually
migrate my `Django Developer Kit Appliance <http://bit.ly/byzBLV>`__ to
use `Foresight Linux <http://foresightlinux.org>`__ as the underlying
operating system… and I am proud to announce that I have made huge
strides toward this goal!

Thanks to the guidance of some fellow
`rPathians <http://www.rpath.com>`__, I managed to get an almost ready
for production **Django 1.2.3 + PostgreSQL 8.4 + Python 2.6.2** and
**lots** of **Django modules** and **latest versions** for **Git,
Mercurial, Bzr**, and **Subversion** ready to be used!

What didn’t make into this version? The web based management system is
not present and is very possible I may have missed a small package along
the way. But I will keep updating the appliance with newer versions of
Django modules and will try to create a helpful environment Â for Django
developers out there! And you can always keep your appliance up to date
running **conary updateall** from the command line.

Oh, I have created a default djangouser and djangoproject user and
database (PostgreSQL) for you too!

Feel like taking the appliance for a spin? The following images are
