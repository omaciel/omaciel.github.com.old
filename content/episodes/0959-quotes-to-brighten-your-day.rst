Kind of ironic how my post titled “\ `Stop whining and improve your
life <http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=884>`__" attracted so much negativity
in the comments area. It became very clear to me, however, that most
were just too eager to make assumptions about my intention or probably

a light but pleasant reading for a lazy afternoon. I sincerely hope
you’ll enjoy them too.
