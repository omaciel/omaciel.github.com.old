While telling a co-worker how I managed to listen to my private \*.ogg
music files, I was asked if my music collection was “\ **legal**?”
Having never spent much attention or time trying to understand what the
music industry’s peeve with music swappers, I started to think out loud
what the answer should be to his question. The logic I used was as
follows:

    *All of my current music files were originally encoded from my own,
    store-bought CDs… I have pretty much gotten away with keeping the
    real CDs at home because [lengthy explanation followed here]… and
    decided to keep a digitized copy stored in one of my many external
    hard drives. Following the fact that I legally own my CDs, I can
    only assume that the answer to your question is: **Yes**, my current
    music collection IS **legal**!!!*

Now, if I were to take one of my own store-bought CDs and gave it away
to a friend while still retaining my digitized copy, does that make me
violate any copyright law concerning to the music industry? Does it mean
that I never actually own the CD (for I cannot do as I please with it)?
