The third and last day at the exposition was without a doubt the best
day of them all! There were times when I was completely surrounded by
people who just wanted to chit-chat… but there were many chances to just
walk around, talk to people, take a few extra pictures and not worry
about leaving my helper alone in the booth.Ã‚Â  Some of the highlights
in my oppinion were:

-  The guys from `Slashdot <http://slashdot.org/>`__ were playing XBox
   360 all day long using the huge screen they had set up at their
   lounge area;

-  They also brought in a freezer filled to the top with ice cream,
   which quickly vanished as they started distributing it together with
   other things such as t-shirts;
-  I got to meet Komander Taco, the “brain”behind Slashdot;

-  I got to meet Jon Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mad DogÃ¢â‚¬Â? Hall;
-  I got to meet `Mitch
   Pirtle <http://dev.joomla.org/component/option,com_jd-wp/Itemid,33/p,83/>`__,
   one of the core developers for `Joomla <http://www.joomla.org>`__ and
   convinced him to be a guest speaker at the MySQL User Group I go to
   in the near future.Ã‚Â  Without a doubt, a great guy!

-  Got to meet `Ivan
   KrstiÃ„â€¡ <https://launchpad.net/people/krstic>`__, one of the
   co-authors for the upcoming book Ã¢â‚¬Å“\ `The Official Ubuntu
   Book <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132435942/sr=8-2/qid=1144586788/ref=pd_bbs_2/102-5290391-8745702?%5Fencoding=UTF8>`__.Ã¢â‚¬Â?
   He approached our booth and pretended to be a new Linux user, asking
   me: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why should I use Ubuntu Linux?Ã¢â‚¬Â? and Ã¢â‚¬Å“How is
   the server version?Ã¢â‚¬Â? I gave him the best answer I could come up
   with at the moment, telling him that he should use which ever
   distribution better served his needs, even if that meant using
   something else besides Ubuntu.Ã‚Â  In the end he told me his true
   identity and told me I had actually given a very good answer;
-  I met and convinced Jack, one of the developers from the
   `Fedora <http://fedora.redhat.com/>`__ project to also be a guest
   speaker;

-  Someone visiting from New Jersey brought me his PowerPC so I could
   take a look and help him figure out why his wireless card wouldn’t
   work.Ã‚Â  After playing with it for a bit I noticed that I couldn’t
   get an IP address assigned to his card.Ã‚Â  Luckly, Joseph, the lead
   PowerPC developer for Gentoo Linux was around and was more than happy
   to lend us a hand.Ã‚Â  After performing a real
   Ã¢â‚¬Å“operationÃ¢â‚¬Â? on the powerbook, we realized that the
   problem was due to an older version of the firware.Ã‚Â  We promptly
   walked to the Mac guys who were also at the expo and after doing some
   pretty neat booting tricks via the firewire ports, we were able to
   upgrade the firmaware and get the PowerPC to connect to the local
   access point! |;)|

-  Another pretty neat thing that took place at the expo was when near
   the closing time, the O’Reilly guys simply decided to give all of the
   books they hand on display (a couple of thousands in my rough
   estimate) away!Ã‚Â  Amazing!!!Ã‚Â  I walked out of the exposition
   floor with a **whole box** of great books!Ã‚Â  I intend to share the
   loot with people from the user groups I go to…

Overall, I got to meet a great deal of interesting people and I just
couldn’t mention all of the events that took place over those 3
days!Ã‚Â  I ended up spending approximately $900 out of my pocket for
the priviledge of representing something I trully believe in!Ã‚Â  Add
the fact that I will not get paid for this week and you can imagine the
financial blow I have taken…Ã‚Â  But no money could have bought the
experience and sheer pleasure to talk to several hundred users who
wouldn’t stop bragging how much they liked our distro!

Just like the Visa adds on TV:Ã‚Â  PRICELESS!
