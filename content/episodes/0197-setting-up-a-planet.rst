No, this is not a post about the creation of the universe and such.
`Planet <http://planetplanet.org/>`__ “\ *is a flexible feed aggregator.
It downloads news feeds published by web sites and aggregates their
content together into a single combined feed, latest news first.*" In
other words, it is one of the best ideas since the sliced bread was
invented. I have come to rely heavily on planets to get my daily dose of
tech news (as you can see from the blogs I have listed here)… `Planet
Gnome <http://planet.gnome.org/>`__, `Planet
Debian <http://planet.debian.org/>`__, `Planet
Ubuntu <http://planet.ubuntulinux.org/%0A>`__\ … there seems to be a
planet for almost anything you can think of. Instead of subscribing to
individual blogs, you can read through a whole bunch of different ones
that share (most of the time) one common interest.

Today I realized that, as far as I know, there aren’t any technical
planets out there aimed at Brazilian (or Portuguese speaking) readers.
Being that I have spent a big chunk of my personal time working with the
Brazilian Ubuntu team, I thought that maybe a Planet Ubuntu Brazil would
be a great idea to allow better communication of ideas (for those who
don’t subscribe to our mailing list) between the members as well as
allow “outsiders” to take a peek at what’s going on with their favorite
Linux distribution and our effort to translate every single package from
English to Brazilian Portuguese.

Reading
`this <http://baruch.ev-en.org/blog/Misc/the-making-of-a-planet>`__ post
today only added more fuel to the fire! So far, the replies to my idea
(via mailing list) has been but a small trickle… Hopefully, as the day
gets in the way, more people will read about the idea and reply with
comments or suggestions.
