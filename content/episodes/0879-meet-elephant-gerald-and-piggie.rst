Got back home tonight to find our dining table covered by books that Yv
got at the library today. This is something that happens quite often and
it never stops amazing me just how much she loves to read! So even
though it was almost 21:00 and I had just walked in from work, we set by
the table and started reading some of her books.

books must be some of the most amazingly funny books to read to your
kids! No matter how many times we read them, the stories never lose
their power to make us laugh out loud. This works best if you act out
the book and try to make funny voices. Fun for the entire family for
sure! :)
