Trying Out Perforce

Tonight I want to take a quick break from playing WoW and install
`Perforce <http://www.perforce.com>`__ SCM System at home:

    The Perforce SCM System features comprehensive software
    configuration management capabilities built around a scalable
    client/server architecture. Requiring only TCP/IP, developers can
    access the Perforce Server through a variety of Perforce clients
    (GUIs for several platforms, Web, or Command-Line). Perforce can be
    deployed quickly and easily, and requires minimal administration,
    even for large or distributed sites.

Having used Microsoft’s Visual Source Safe (VSS) for most part of my
professional life (now am being forced to use some old version of
PVCS!!! ARGHH!), I want to see if this tool could replace VSS. I first
heard of them at this year’s Linux World Expo in Boston and was very
impressed with it, specially since it will run on Linux and has a 2
user/seat free version.

I’m not sure if I’m going to install the server under a Linux or Windows
system yet…
