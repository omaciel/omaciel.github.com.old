Last night was my weekly night to play games with my friend
`Vinny <http://www.supertoadman.com/cs/blogs/supertoadman/default.aspx>`__.
I have been playing `Enemy Territory <http://www.enemy-territory.com>`__
every Wednesday night since last Summer with a few cancellations here
and there. Earlier this year Vinny convinced me to try `World of
Warcraft <http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/>`__, a very addictive online
multiplayer game. I was hooked from the start but not being able to
“dedicate” to more than a couple of hours a week I eventually lost
interest. I guess a big factor for my lack of interest was the fact that
the people I knew online just kept racking up levels and moved on to
different realms and tougher quests, while I was still stuck at level 4!

Well, last night I convinced Vinny to create a new character and we
spent the next 2-3 hours roaming around, completing as many quests as we
could. By the end of the night I was pretty close to (one more quest
should do it) moving to a Level 10 Warlock! Having an experienced
“guide” to show me around made a huge difference and I had a real blast!
Needless to say, I’m hooked again and will try really hard to tally a
few more hours during the weekend. For those interested/curious, I play
as “\ **ElGringo**\ ”, a Warlock under the `Ghost
Force <http://www.ghost-force.net>`__ Guild on the Bloodhoof realm!
