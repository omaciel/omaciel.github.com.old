As I see our nation crumbling down before my eyes, the republican
candidates to the presidency of the United States concentrated on
spewing garbage about the war in Iraq and building a fence to protect us
against illegal immigrants. I wish they would use their time more wisely
talking about how to minimize the huge f\*\*\* up our current President
has gotten us into.

The last republican’s debate (not the one held tonight, but the one
before) had all candidates answer the following question:

    Do you think the war (with Iraq) was necessary? Were the thousands
    of casualties worthy?

Every single candidate with the exception of one answer **yes**!

Tonight’s debate was more like a 2 participants only debate, with
Huckabee and Ron Paul having to sit and watch Romney and McCain duke it
out on pointless discussions.

Glad to see Edwards out of the race… and Giulliani too (couldn’t stand
him when I worked in New York)!!! Looking forward to tomorrow’s democrat
debate.

Ahhh… John McCain keeps saying that when he decides to do so, he wants
to “bring back our troops with honor.” I wonder how many people would
just rather see their family member return **alive**!
