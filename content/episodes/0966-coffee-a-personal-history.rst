I first got hooked on drinking coffee back in the Spring of 1994 while
attending a **Microbiology** class at **Pace University**. Our class
started way too early for me and our professor (can’t remember her name
right now) was this tiny old lady who barely raised her voice over the
decibel level that dogs can hear. The class and subject were very
interesting and by the end of the semester I felt very confident about
my laboratory skills (and developed a phobia about anything that was not
coated with some type of anti bacterial product).Â  But it was extremely
hard to stay awake listening to that monotonous voice that early… so
coffee became my best friend and probably indirectly responsible for the
good grade I received for that class!

Once that semester was over I dropped my coffee consumption to zero and
went back to obtaining caffeine from other sources, mostly from soft
drinks. I didn’t really missed it at all and it wasn’t until I got to my
last year and had to take **Physical Chemistry** that I became an avid
drinker. Obviously, as a college student I’d drink whatever brand of
coffee was being served at the cafeteria, but as time progressed and I
became a bit more in control of my own expenses, I started
“experimenting”. By the time I got married I had established a good
relationship with **`CafÃ© Pilon
Espresso <http://www.javacabana.com/?p=catalog&parent=3>`__**. For a
while it was the only coffee I bought for my house. I would every now
and then buy a cup of **StarBucks** coffee, but Pilon was the one that
day in, day out satisfied my caffeine need. I really enjoy a strong
coffee, so I became fairly addicted to it. Now, don’t get turned off by
the **Espresso** in its name, as this coffee is super smooth with a rich
and flavorful taste that is sure to perk you up.

At work we usually drink `Counter
Culture <http://www.counterculturecoffee.com>`__, a brand I had never
heard of until I moved here from **Northern New Jersey**. It was weird
to me that most engineers would prefer that over the bag of StarBucks
coffee sitting right next to it, but after having drunk Counter Culture
for over 3 years now, I believe my StarBucks fetish is over.

With the recent economic recession I had to look for cheaper
alternatives to Pilon for my house. Unfortunately not all of the
alternatives I tried passed my criteria for a good coffee: strong,
darkly roasted, not bitter and not acidic. That’s when my wife suggested
we tried `Trader Joe’s <http://www.traderjoes.com>`__ dark roast coffee,
a couple of bucks cheaper and very promising with a great aroma. It
didn’t take me very long to determine it to be the definite replacement
for Pilon: the very first cup was enough to convert me to a Trader Joe’s
coffee drinker!

After hearing some of my co-workers bragging about `Peet’s Coffee and
Tea <http://www.peets.com/shop/coffee.asp>`__, I waited until my coffee
supply started to run low to have an excuse and ran down to the nearest
**Harris Teeter** to snag a bag of their
`Sumatra <http://www.peets.com/shop/coffee_detail.asp?id=42&cid=1004>`__
coffee. At US$7.99 (discounted with a VIC card) I thought more than
twice before paying the cashier, but my curiosity (and the delicious
aroma coming from the bag) got the best of me in the end. It probably
won’t be until Tuesday that I will try Peet’s Coffee as I still have a
bit of Trader Joe’s left in the house… and at US$7.99++ a pop, chances
are I will still be drinking Trader Joe’s for the foreseeable future. I
do however hope that I won’t be disappointed at Peet’s Coffee… Maybe it
could become one of those bottles of wine that you only crack open for
special occasions and that you drink on tall, wide mugs and not on
crystal glasses.
