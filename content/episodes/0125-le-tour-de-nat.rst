Very amusing `play-by-play <http://rlove.org/log/2005071601>`__ recount
of `Nat Friedman <http://www.nat.org/>`__'s adventorous attempt to
travel from his hometown of Boston to the very tip of Cape Cod by bike!
The reason: Insanity could be a great part of it, but apparently he just
wants to prove `someone <http://joeshaw.org/>`__ wrong. Apparently Nat
has to make it back to Boston for a party later the same evening.
Updated every so often with pictures, videos, and witty comments. A
must!
