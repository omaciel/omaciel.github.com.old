Someone had commented on a previous post about a media player for
Windows called `Foobar2000 <http://foobar2000.org/>`__. Having just been
swept off my feet by
`Billy <http://www.sheepfriends.com/?page=billy>`__, I decided to give
it a try. I chose the “Special” download option and was very impressed
with the extensive options for music file formats available. There’s
also a good amount of modules or plugins that can be downloaded from the
web site. The interface is very simple and minimalistic, focusing almost
that entirely on the task at hand: just playing your music files. I
threw some .ogg and .mp3 files at it and wasn’t disappointed. I then
tried one of my .acc audible books but alas, the stupid
encryption/protection got in the way. Satisfied with my experiment, I
decided to perform yet another “benchmark” to see which media player I
have used the most resources. **Disclaimer:** I’m not by a long shot an
expert in benchmarking noir have I specialized tools to perform such a
task. I simply relied on the information displayed by Microsoft’s Task
Manager window. The following are my findings for the applications
listed below (running both .mp3 and .ogg files at work, except for
Winamp which doesn’t support .ogg playback AFAIK):

I must confess I was amazed at the performance comparison between
Microsoft MP and Winamp! I must admit I was expecting that WMP would be
the big bloat in the group… Too bad I don’t have Real Player installed
at work (come to think of it, I don’t have it installed at home
either!!!) so I could add to the experiment. For those of you who are
running a slow system or optimizing greedy users as I am, the top 2
applications listed here have my full endorsement (and before anyone
ask, I do not work or get paid by either one of them… :) ).
