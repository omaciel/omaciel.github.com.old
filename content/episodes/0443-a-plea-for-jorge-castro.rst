I was extremely sad to find out over the weekend that the always lovable
`Jorge Castro <http://www.whiprush.org/>`__ has decided to take a back
seat in the Gnu/Linux world. I had a chance to meet him over the UDS-MTV
and was very impressed by his genuine interest and willingness to “make
the world a better place.” (c) It is very unfortunate that we have so
many people out there who rather spill poison than use their energy to
be constructive!

Jorge, I really hope you’ll reconsider your decision! The community
needs people like you, and I’m sure I am not the only one who thinks
this way! I strongly believe that your inner drive is much stronger than
all the negativity you’ve been exposed to!!! Think of any bitter words
that have been tossed your way as just another one of those obstacles in
life… just a minor pebble that I’m sure you’ll get over, for it will
make you stronger!!! And boy, won’t it make it all much sweeter when you
reach the summit and you look at all you’ve accomplished in your
journey!

Warm regards from a Brazilian who thinks very highly of you!
