I have! I just recently got a hold of a US$30 Amazon gift certificate
for participating of a 1-hour phone study. I could have used it and
bought something for me, right? Instead, I decided to present it to
Jacek Åšliwerski, the guy behind `Open-Tran <http://open-tran.eu/>`__.
There is not a day that I don’t use it for my translations, as I can use
its awesome comparisson tools to QA my work!

How about you? Have you hugged your favorite open source tool today?
