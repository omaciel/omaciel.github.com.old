**Legend:**

| **Ship’s Captain** - The V.P. for a certain local organization.
| **Slave Master** - Works for the Ship’s Captain. Has the ability to
send shivers down the spines of most slaves and turn her Pacers into
docile puppies.
| **Pacer** - Works for the Slave Master, mostly by pretending to
control the Slaves and licking the Slave Master’s feet with their
bifurcated tongues.
| **Slaves** - Bottom dwellers at said “ship.” Spend their days avoiding
the “ship’s staff” and minding other Slaves’ business.
| **Rowing (both hands)** - Equivalent of doing some type of work.
| **Rowing (one hand)**- Doing less work while using other hand for
other business; usually talking on the cell phone.
| **Galleys** - Outside of your work area.
| **Chatting** - Talking about non-work related subjects.
| **Land of the Rum** - A place in the Caribbean sea.
| **Slashing** - Type of work that would insult the brain of an amoeba…
oh wait… Amoebas don’t even have brains…
| **Amoeba** - Our ship’s DBAs.

**Story:**

| *[Slave Master]*: … and I just wanted to talk to you about something…
| *[Slave]*: sure!
| *[Slave Master]*: It has been brought to my attention by the **Ship’s
Captain** that you’ve been seen **rowing** with one hand a few times
down in the **galleys**\ … Also, he’s seen you chatting with the
**slave** from the **Land of the Rum** a couple of times.
| *[Slave]*: … uh… ok…
| *[Slave Master]:* I need to ask you: Are we giving you enough
**rowing** or do you need some **slashing** to keep you motivated?
| *[Slave]:* No, no… My **rowing** routine is just fine… and…
| *[Slave Master]:* … you see, since you’re not a fulltime rower at our
ship, you’re supposed to row all the time… All biological functions or
personal needs should be withheld until designated times, as defined by
your **pacer**\ … Preferably, when the ship is not moving and the sun
has gone down… Fulltime rowers, however, are exempt from the above rules
and can pretty much function as normal human beings.
| *[Slave]:* …. I want to thank you for reminding me so kindly of my
position in this ship’s social ladder. I will hold our conversation very
close to my heart and as a sign of my gratitude I’d like to request some
more **slashes** with the spiked whip?
