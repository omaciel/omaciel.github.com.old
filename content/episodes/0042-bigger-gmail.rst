I’m really loving this “war” between `Google <http://www.google.com>`__
and `Yahoo <http://www.yahoo.com>`__, battling to see who attracts more
users. I think we, the “middle man,” will only gain in the end. Today
Google announced they’re increasing everyone’s
`gmail <http://gmail.google.com>`__ account to a whopping **2GB**!!!
Also, they’ve added the ability to write emails using rich text
features, such as: Bold, Italics, Underline, Select a special font, Font
Size, Font Color, Background Color, Remove Formatting, Hyperlink Text,
Numbered List, Bulleted List, Indent Less, Indent More, Quote Text, Left
Align, Center Align, Right Align.

I say let them keep this going… Hope Microsoft will also put on their
gloves and present us with something that will sweep us off our feets!
;)

**Update:** The rollout seems to be moving right along… So far I’m up to
1337MB! It seems to be in synch with the animated counter they have on
`gmail <http://gmail.google.com>`__'s main site!
