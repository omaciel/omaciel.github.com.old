While I was busy at work, `Openbox
3.4.5 <http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/Main_Page>`__ was released!
As always, I’ve packaged it for Foresight Linux (the 2-devel branch) and
you can get it using **conary** or **PackageKit**.

|Openbox 3.4.5|

I also took the time last night to pimp
`PyPanel <http://pypanel.sourceforge.net/>`__ with a few patches and
bump `Nitrogen <http://projects.l3ib.org/nitrogen/>`__ to 1.2 (not shown
in the screenshot).

Speaking of Nitrogen, I looked around for an easy and straight forward
way to change the desktop wallpaper in a non-GNOME environment and was
amazed at how GNOME-centric they all were. Some hacks involved issuing
gconf2 commands… :/ Anyone know of a pythonic, non-GNOME-centric way of
doing this? Maybe using python-xlib?
