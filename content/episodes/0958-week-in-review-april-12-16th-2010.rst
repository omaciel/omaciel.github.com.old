Here’s what happened this week:

#. `Radio Tray 0.5.1 <http://../?p=880>`__

   -  "It is with great pleasure that I announce the release of Radio
      Tray 0.5.1! I have been following the development of this tiny
      streaming media player from the very start and even cloned it so
      that I could play with it on BitBucket."

#. `Stop whining and improve your life <http://../?p=884>`__

   -  "During your day to day conversation with your friends and family
      members, do you find yourself talking about work or life in
      general in a negative manner?"

#. `Learning Inkscape? <http://../?p=890>`__

   -  "Lately I have found myself spending more and more time playing
      with Inkscape, the amazing open source vector graphic editor! The
      main reason being that my oldest daughter has shown interest in
      drawing and graphic design."

#. `Command Line Tools with Python OptParse <http://../?p=900>`__

   -  "It is not very uncommon for me to receive some code requests from
      friends looking for a little help to â€œmake something easierâ€?.
      Iâ€™m talking about those pesky day to day things that after a
      while makes you go: â€œIf I could only push a button and have it
      done!â€?"

#. `From the â€œBetter Than Sliced Breadâ€? Department:
   Terminator <http://../?p=914>`__

   -  "Basically, think about opening a single terminal (console) window
      and then splitting it down the middle (vertically) to get now two
      separate and independent terminalsâ€¦ and then splitting the left
      terminal horizontally, giving you now three terminalsâ€¦ and
      thenâ€¦ well, you probably get the drift by now."
