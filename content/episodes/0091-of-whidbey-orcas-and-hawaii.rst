With the upcoming release of Whidbey (Visual Studio 2005) scheduled for
some time this Summer, Microsoft has already been busy working on the
next 2 versions: Orca and Hawaii. *"Microsoft officials said that while
Whidbey will help developers target the upcoming Longhorn operating
system, Orcas will be the version of the tool set that will enable
developers to ride what the company calls the Longhorn wave and tap the
new features of the operating system. Hawaii will come shortly after
Orcas to provide even more Longhorn-specific functionality and more."*
