My friend `devnet <http://linux-blog.org/>`__ told me today as we got
some coffee about what was possibly one of the very first micro bloggers
in history… when he finally gave me the
`link <http://www.wibsite.com/wiblog/dull/>`__ to this guy’s site I
laughed so hard I almost had coffee (my precioussss) coming out of my
nose! With posts such as “Tidying some pencils”, “Standing in the middle
of the room” and “Looking at a wall”, it was really hard not to laugh!

So for all you professional Tweeters out there, check out the link for
some fresh material… and the next time you “tweet” about how blissfull
it is when you scratched your knee, every flippin’ hour, it may be a bit
more interesting for those who somehow still manage to follow your feed.
