-  Built a MT-Daapd Linux appliance to share my music at home. Installed
   it in a machine with 1GB of RAM and am now as happy as I can be. The
   whole thing weighs in at 237MB (I’ve included vim, openssh, libogg
   plus a few other nuggets) and off course everything is managed by the
   awesome `conary <http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary>`__ technology.
   I’ve also added ushare (upnp support) and am hoping to make it so
   that sharing videos and music can be all done via a web interface. I
   haven’t made the installable ISO or VMWare image available yet but
   will do it soon.
-  Speaking of other technologies, I’ve been playing with a MacBook
   these last 2 days and am generally happy with the experience.
   Everything just… works! What? No need to tweak configuration files?
   With the exception of the lack of a right-click button, so far I give
   it 2 thumbs up.
-  Since we’re talking about operating systems, I was really glad to see
   that `Foresight <http://www.foresightlinux.org/>`__ Linux has been
   awarded the `2008 Ovatio
   Award <http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/ars-awards-2008.ars/7>`__
   as the **Distribution of the Year**, and honor that is shared with
   its other green cousin, `openSUSE <http://www.opensuse.org/>`__. I
   have been running Foresight for over 2 years now and I just cannot
   imagine any other distribution that would give me the same
   flexibility, stability and coolness combo. You want to see a
   distribution that knows how to be a first citizen in the upstream
   world? Come talk to me on #foresight on Freenode.
-  Speaking of being a good citizen with upstream projects, if you speak
   **Brazilian Portuguese** you’ll be glad to know that the
   `GNOME <http://gnome.org>`__, `KDE <http://kde.org>`__,
   `XFCE <http://xfce.org>`__, and
   `Openbox <http://icculus.org/openbox>`__ desktop environments are in
   excelente shape as far as the localization effort goes. The Brazilian
   translation team for `Fedora <http://fedoraproject.org/>`__ has also
   done a great job at delivering a localized desktop with their latest
   release! Now, I don’t know where you get your translations but if it
   isn’t being pulled (without modifications) from upstream, good luck
   pal!
-  Finally, between the many hours I have put into work these days (ever
   wonder why I haven’t blogged much? now you know) I have managed to
   mess around with Django to scratch a need. If I were to describe what
   I think about this framework using as few words as possible, w00t and
   teh aw3s0m3 comes to mind! By the way, writing code with 2 other guys
   while discussing ideas over Skype? Great XP experience for those who
   cannot afford to travel!
