It’s been a while since I last blogged but my life has been pretty
hectic for the last 2 weeks. I have spent more time flying from NY
to Raleigh/Durham than actually anywhere else. The airports at JFK,
LGA, and RDU had strangely started to feel “confortable” and I could
pretty much tell anyone where the best spots were for the wi-fi.

Well, got to meet a lot of interesting people, and better yet, had a few
job interviews along the way. The thing was that my interviews were
both in NY/NJ and NC, which explains why I was flying so much. Most
of my interviews took me pretty “deep” into the whole interviewing
“machinery”, most of the time yielding 2 or 3 follow-up visits. I am
very happy to say that one of these interviews was with
`rPath <http://www.rpath.com/>`__, and after a series of short visits, I
can proudly say that they have made me an offer and I accepted it!
For those who followed my last few entries, remember how I had decided
that I had enough of the rat race, and was looking for a place where I
could be myself and do some cool stuff? A job that would give me
some serious dose of challenge and allow me to grow as a
professional? I found it!

The guys at rPath are really cool and down to Earth, and my boss is just
wicked cool! I’m extremelly excited about this opportunity and so is
my whole family! This Friday I will break my apartment lease and
leave New Jersey. Will it be for good? Something tells me
so… It will be a bitter sweet moment for me, for New Jersey is where
I spent the first 16 years of my “American” life… but North Carolina is
where I can see myself growing roots and seeing my kids grow!

I have to thank everyone who has shown me support, either directly or by
sending me feedback on my blog. Keep an eye out for some new
announcementes and even some pictures from Chapel Hill, the new
residency for the Maciels (my wife Elizabeth, my daughter Yv, our
soon-to-be-born daughter Kate, and me)!
