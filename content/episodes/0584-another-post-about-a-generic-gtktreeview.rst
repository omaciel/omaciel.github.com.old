I figured, why not whip up a quick sample code to show off the
genericlist I just published? So I chose the
`Tasks <http://pimlico-project.org/tasks.html>`__ application, written
in C/C++, as my target. A few minutes later, my “port” was born:

|Tasks |

The application to the left is the one I whipped up… the one to the
right is the real deal! Obviously I didn’t bother writing up the code to
actually store information, and this exercise was meant to be like the
penguins in the movie “\ **The Wild**"… to look cute and cuddly. :)
