This post is my 2 cents about Jad’s latest post trying to `stir things
up and attract more
translators <http://syntux.net/blog/2008/08/28/boosting-the-translation-process/>`__
to the Ubuntu community! Having led the Brazilian team for a couple of
years myself, I wanted to point out a couple of things Iâ€™ve learned
along the way. Obviously advices are best taken when asked for, but here
it goes anyway:

-  Beware that 300 volunteers working at the same time without a robust
   and clear way of knowing whoâ€™s doing what will make it impossible
   for your team to manage;
-  Also, with this many people contributing with single, hand picked
   strings is extremelly detrimental to the overal quality of the entire
   package, not to mention the entire suite;
-  I have always liked the idea of contributions being done upstream
   first, and then tricklying it down to distros and what not. It is my
   dream and goal to make sure that Ubuntu reverses this trend and start
   sending contributions upstream (translations). Check out my
   blueprint:
   `https://blueprints.edge.launchpad.net/rosetta/+spec/translation-workflow-and-notification-system <https://blueprints.edge.launchpad.net/rosetta/+spec/translation-workflow-and-notification-system>`__

Well, back to work I go. :)
