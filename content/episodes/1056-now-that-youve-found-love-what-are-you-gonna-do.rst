Now that you have downloaded and installed the latest `Foresight Linux
2.5
release <http://www.foresightlinux.org/release/announcing-foresight-linux-2-5-0/>`__,
here are a couple of things you may want to do:

-  **Update Your System**: Since Foresight has a rolling release
   schedule, we already have updates for you, including and newer
   **MPlayer** with support for **Blue-Ray**! 

       Run *sudo conary updateall*

-  **Install Chromium web browser**: Try this pretty cool web browser
   made by **Google**. Got a **gMail** account? Take advantage of the
   bookmarks and password synchronization feature and have it all
   seamlessly integrated!

       Run *sudo conary update chromium*

-  **Install Hotot** and keep up with your friends on **Twitter**!

       Run *sudo conary update hotot*

-  **Rock out with Spotify** and enjoy a great music service!

       Run *sudo conary update spotify*

-  **Terminator** is one of the very first things I install on my
   systems and if you rely on using a solid and feature-filled terminal
   like I do, you will definitely install it too!

       Run *sudo conary update terminator*

-  Speaking of **must haves** my list would be incomplete with out
   installing **Dropbox**! I keep all of my “dot” files such as vimrc
   and bashrc in a directory hosted by Dropbox and then symlink them in
   my systems so that whenever I make any change to one of them, the
   change is propagated instantaneously to my other systems.

       Run *sudo conary update nautilus-dropbox*

Obviously, feel free to drop by **#foresight** on **freenode** and let
us know what you think of Foresight and how we can improve your
experience! **Your Distro Should Be Cool!**
