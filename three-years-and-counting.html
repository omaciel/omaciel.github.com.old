                <p>Making a quick pit stop to mark this milestone in my professional
career: today is my 3-year anniversary at Red Hat! Time has certainly
flown by and I really cannot believe that it has been three years since
I joined this company.</p>
<p>I know it is sort of cliche to say &quot;I can not believe that it has been
this long...&quot; and so on and so forth, but it is so true. Back then I
joined a relatively new project with very high ambitions, and the first
few months had me swimming way out in the deepest part of the pool,
trying to learn all 'Red Hat-things' and <strong>Clojure</strong> for the existing
automation framework (now we are fully using <strong>Python</strong>).</p>

<p>I did a lot of swimming for sure, and through the next months, through
many long days and weekends and hard work, tears and sweat (you know,
your typical life for a <strong>Quality Engineer</strong> worth his/her salt), I
succeeded in adding <strong>and</strong> wearing many types of hats, going from a
<strong>Senior Quality Engineer</strong>, to a <strong>Supervisor</strong> of the team, to
eventually becoming the <strong>Manager</strong> for a couple of teams, spread over 4
different countries. Am I bragging? Maaaybe a little bit :) but my point
is really to highlight a major key factor that made this rapid ascension
path possible: Red Hat's work philosophy and culture of rewarding those
who work hard and truly embrace the company! Sure, I worked really hard,
but I have worked just as hard before in previous places and gotten
nowhere really fast! Being recognized and rewarded for your hard work is
something new to me, and I owe a great debt of gratitude to those who
took the time to acknowledge my efforts and allowed me room to grow
within this company!</p>
<p>The best part of being a Red Hatter for 3 years? Being surrounded by an
enormous pool of talented, exciting people who not only enjoy what they
do, but are always willing to teach you something new, and/or to drop
what they're working on to lend you a helping hand! There is not a
single day that I don't learn something new, and thankfully I don't see
any sign of this trend stopping :) Have I mentioned that I <strong>love</strong> my
teammates too? What a great bunch of guys!!! Getting up early in the
morning and walking to my home office (yeah, they let me work remotely
too) day in, day out, is never a drag because I just know that there are
new things to learn and new adventures and 'achievements to unlock'
right around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>I am Red Hat!!!</strong></p>
