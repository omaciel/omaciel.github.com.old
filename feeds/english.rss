&lt;img alt="Podcasts" src="https://omaciel.fedorapeople.org/podcast-image.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone who has run his own &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://castalio.info/"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; for several years (albeit
not generating a lot of content lately), it took me quite some time to
actually start &lt;em&gt;listening&lt;/em&gt; to podcasts myself. Ironic, I know, but I
guess the main reason behind this was because I was always reading
code at work and eventually, no matter how hard I tried, I just
couldn't pay attention to what was being said! No matter how
interesting the topic being discussed was or how engaging the hosts
(or hosts) were, my brain would be so focused on reading code that
everything else just turned into white noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, fast forward a couple of years and I still am reading code
(though not as much as I used to due to a new role), and I still have
a hard time listening to podcast while at work... so I decided to only
listen to them when I was &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; working. Simple, right? But it took
me a while to change that for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I now listen to podcasts while driving (which I don't really
do a lot of since I work from home 99.99% of the time) or when I go
for walks, and after a while I have started following a handful of
them which are now part of my weekly routine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bookriot.com/listen/shows/allthebooks"&gt;All The Books&lt;/a&gt; which provide me with an up to date list of
suggestions for what books to read next. They're pretty regular with
their episodes, so I can always count on listening about new books
pretty much every week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bookriot.com/listen/shows/thepodcast"&gt;Book Riot&lt;/a&gt; for another dose of more news about books!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hacktheentrepreneur.com/"&gt;Hack the Entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt; to keep up with people who are making
something about what they are passionate about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://howwegettonext.com/tagged/wonderland-podcast"&gt;Wonderland Podcast&lt;/a&gt; which I only started listening to a few weeks
back but it has turned into one of my favorite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://soundcloud.com/science-vs"&gt;Science Vs&lt;/a&gt; another new addition to my list, with entertaining
takes at interesting topics such as 'the G-spot', 'Fracking', 'Gun
Control' and 'Organic Food'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I was introduced to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia"&gt;Invisibilia&lt;/a&gt; and though I only listened to
the first 10 minutes (I was giving the link during working hours, so
no go for me), I'm already very interested and will follow it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have other podcasts that I am still subscribed to, but these
listed here are the ones that I am still following every episode.
Maybe if I had to drive to work every day or went for walks more
often, maybe then I would listen to more podcasts? Trust me though, I
rather continue listening to only a small set of them than drive to
work every day. Don't get me wrong, I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; going to work, but
that's 2 hours/day of my life that I rather spend at home :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about you? What podcasts do you find yourself going back to every
time a new episode is published? Would you mind sharing your
suggestions (and why you like the podcasts) with me here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Review of 2015" src="https://omaciel.fedorapeople.org/bookshelf.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another year has gone by and I guess it is time to review the things I
set out to do and grade myself on how well (or poorly) I fared. Here
are some of my goals for 2015:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="read-70-books"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Read 70 Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grade: &lt;strong&gt;PASS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I had a very, very busy year at work, with many releases
of &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat Satellite 5&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat Satellite 6&lt;/strong&gt; shipped to our
customers, I managed to surpass my goal of reading 70 books, finishing
the year with a whopping &lt;strong&gt;79&lt;/strong&gt; books read! You can see the books I
read here: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2015/12048315"&gt;Year in Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I also spent a good chunk of my time looking at old, used
books, and my personal book collection increased considerably. At one
point I had so many piles of books lying around the house that I had
to buy 4 new book cases to store them. At first I wanted to have them
custom made, but the estimates I got from 3-4 different people were
way out of my budget. In the end I went with 4 &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40279788/#/40263848"&gt;Billy Bookcases&lt;/a&gt; from
Ikea, which cost me about 10 times less!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see what I'm reading or want to recommend a book which
you think I might enjoy reading, please feel free to add me on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/omaciel"&gt;GoodReads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="write-a-book"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Write a Book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grade: &lt;strong&gt;FAIL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I utterly failed my attempt, or better yet, lack of attempt to write a
book. I did have lots of ideas for some short stories, but it was only
around &lt;strong&gt;July&lt;/strong&gt; that I started writing them in my notebook. I have
around 3-4 rough drafts put together and I hope that I can transcribe
them from the notebook onto another media, perhaps this blog?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="travel-abroad"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Travel Abroad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grade: &lt;strong&gt;PASS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I had the opportunity of doing a bit of traveling, and I
already have a couple of trips planned for the new year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;February: I went back to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno"&gt;Brno&lt;/a&gt; in the Czech Republic for work, and
attended the very first &lt;strong&gt;QE Camp&lt;/strong&gt; organized by my employer, &lt;strong&gt;Red
Hat&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though &lt;strong&gt;British Airlines&lt;/strong&gt; misplaced my luggage and I
had to wear the same clothes for 3 days while attending the event (I
washed my socks and tidy whities every night and hung them to dry
overnight). It was pretty cold too and I had to make do with a
&lt;strong&gt;UNC&lt;/strong&gt; sweater I had on me. Anyhow, I absolutely &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno"&gt;Brno&lt;/a&gt;
and it was great that I got to work from the office for a few days
and hang out with my fellow Red Hatters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://photos-4.dropbox.com/t/2/AABWqCX-YXi5QB4nFRGrIbEHiTLkzW5pRppen8aeuMqsxQ/12/102224/jpeg/32x32/3/1451620800/0/2/2015-02-08%2012.38.14.jpg/EMutJxjF6ozdBCACKAI/9f9ZtckqDadXsKolbkor5J16LSIA4jQpHlV8Dk9s6Fo?size_mode=3&amp;amp;size=1024x768" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May&lt;/strong&gt;: This time I went to Israel for the first time. It was a very
long flight and when I finally arrived at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Gurion_Airport"&gt;Ben Gurion&lt;/a&gt; airport I
was very tired. I also could not get my cel phone to work there and
since the address to my hotel was in an email from work, I had to
resort to hand gestures and appeal to the good will of others to
figure out that my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://benjamin-hotel.co.il/"&gt;hotel&lt;/a&gt; was in &lt;strong&gt;Herzliya&lt;/strong&gt; and not &lt;strong&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/strong&gt;
as I kept insisting with the cab driver. :) He finally let me use
his iPhone to go online and I arrived safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must say
that I had a great time in Israel, even with the day long meetings
we had every single day. This was the first time I spent a lot of
time with my manager too, and I must say that it was a great
opportunity to see him performing his job, day in, day out. He is
very passionate about his job, but he is also very approachable and
genuinely cares about us, so by the end of the week I felt that the
trip was worth the long distance and all the meetings. I also gave a
presentation about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite"&gt;Red Hat Satellite 6&lt;/a&gt; and talked about some of
the new features that we were working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://photos-6.dropbox.com/t/2/AAB4e0nWWSoPTroflxZ4c-DirAJ1bi0z83tNzG5JIUb7Og/12/102224/jpeg/32x32/3/1451620800/0/2/pavel_og_israel_2015.jpg/EMutJxjF6ozdBCACKAI/KZsuflf14H5ZKHN4hVR1RuSgNNQyhGZcInq4bdyl2_o?size_mode=3&amp;amp;size=1024x768" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I got to meet some
of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://theforeman.org/"&gt;The Foreman&lt;/a&gt; developers in person and it is always great to
be able to meet those folks I spent all year long bugging via
&lt;strong&gt;IRC&lt;/strong&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;July: Another trip to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno"&gt;Brno&lt;/a&gt;, this time for a bunch of meetings
with my &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat Satellite 5 QE&lt;/strong&gt; teammates. The weather was
fantastic and I even managed to meet with some folks whom I had only
interacted online and some old friends from my &lt;strong&gt;GNOME&lt;/strong&gt; days who
now work for &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt;. I was given the opportunity to manage the
&lt;cite&gt;Pulp&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;strong&gt;QE&lt;/strong&gt; team (and I'm still looking for experienced &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;
developers in the Czech Republic or willing to relocate there!) and
once again got to hang out with friends, co-workers and do a bit of
sightseeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://photos-5.dropbox.com/t/2/AADDN3oAIeZ-3SRcIhfiiaBKtNXtsoDcqkSd6AdYUEh0yQ/12/102224/jpeg/32x32/3/1451620800/0/2/2015-07-16%2017.44.48.jpg/EMutJxjF6ozdBCACKAI/8eaPbviOw1vqHDtp3wjDTpjTFVvlmYthCLyXtjdTdrg?size_mode=3&amp;amp;size=1024x768" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;August: Took some time off from work and took the family to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Beach%2C_North_Carolina"&gt;Carolina Beach&lt;/a&gt; for a few days. Got a lot reading done and enjoyed a much needed rest watching the kids running around on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://photos-4.dropbox.com/t/2/AAC7a4q4B-1VXc0b6aovCtuK9BXoR2D-JaHi1cIrXA-ZXw/12/102224/jpeg/32x32/3/1451620800/0/2/2015-08-01%2015.26.31.jpg/EMutJxjF6ozdBCACKAI/rNRNleyOfijr1kUgPYSBx2t5nZ6DUqE5vgdqQcBPLb4?size_mode=3&amp;amp;size=1024x768" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had an opportunity to visit my teammates in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune"&gt;Pune&lt;/a&gt;, India, but decided that I had enough traveling for this year and postponed my trip for next year. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="become-a-better-manager"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Become a Better Manager&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grade: &lt;strong&gt;In Progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I officially became a manager (with about 24 people from 5 different timezones reporting directly to me) I realized that I had to make some changes to my day to day activities in order to be (or attempt to be) a good manager. Some of them were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delegate more: stop doing the day to day activities related to testing our products and/or related to automating functional tests, and focus on coaching folks to do them for me while I focused on other activities that required my attention and time. I must say, I still struggle with this, but only because I have a very hands on approach to work. Luckily for me, I have a great team and lots of support from my own manager, so I feel that I'm moving in the right direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take classes: this year I took several classes provided by Red Hat that were geared toward helping me build strong professional relationships with my teammates and other folks across different teams. I also learned how to build &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Win-Win contracts&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, create &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria"&gt;SMART&lt;/a&gt; goals and have &lt;strong&gt;Crucial Conversations&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though most of the material covered in these classes were nothing new to me, it was nevertheless a great reminder and incentive to start using these techniques at work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incentive teammates to aim higher: throughout the entire year we were faced with many challenges, and I had the opportunity to work with many talented folks. It is such a great feeling coming to work and knowing that everyone around you is just as passionate (or more) about what they do as you are! There are times, however, when folks are not always at their best or some times get a bit lost and lose focus. As a manager I had the opportunity to lend a helping hand within my team and outside to some folks who needed a bit of encouragement and validation about their performance. I spend a huge chunk of 2015 talking to folks, in person or through video conference, listening to their issues and working with them on a plan of attack to help them turn things around. I remember very clearly the many times I struggled with a particular task or role at previous jobs, and how much I wished someone would only listen to me and help me through a rough patch, so I dedicate a lot of my time to being around and available to everyone around. Sometimes it can take several months to tilt the scale to the right direction, but when it happens, it is very gratifying to see the positive effect that it has on folks lives. This is probably the most gratifying thing about being a manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm truly excited about the new year that is about to begin and I have many plans to travel more and spend more time with family, friend and teammates! The year of 2015 was a blast and I hope you all have something to be grateful as well. See you all in 2016!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Books - August 2015" src="https://omaciel.fedorapeople.org/book_review.png" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;August 2015&lt;/strong&gt; I took a break from work and spent about 6 days
enjoying some R&amp;amp;R down the North Carolina shore with my family. I
managed to get through some of the books that were waiting for a long
time for me to get to them, as well as try some new authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="read"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Read&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+Sentinel"&gt;The Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Arthur+C.+Clarke"&gt;Arthur C. Clarke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forgot where I read about how the short story &amp;quot;The Sentinel&amp;quot; was the inspiration for &amp;quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&amp;quot;, but being that I have always considered the latter a great book and movie, I managed to grab a copy of the anthology &amp;quot;The Sentinel&amp;quot; just so that I could read the short story by the same name and see what else Arthur C. Clarke &amp;quot;had to offer.&amp;quot; Interestingly enough (to me), most if not all the other short stories included in this collection could easily be published today and still feel just as futuristic as they probably were back when they were first published! This was yet another one of the books that I read by the beach this Summer and though it didn't blow me away, it was still a very relaxing read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=A+Princess+of+Mars"&gt;A Princess of Mars&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Edgar+Rice+Burroughs"&gt;Edgar Rice Burroughs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last June I got from my family for my birthday &amp;quot;John Carter of Mars&amp;quot; containing the complete series and I was just itching for a good opportunity to start reading it. That chance came up this week as I started reading some of Melville's short stories and found that I needed a bit of a &amp;quot;break&amp;quot;. First off, I have never read Edgar Rice Burroughs before but I do have a copy of &amp;quot;Tarzan of the Apes&amp;quot; also awaiting for a chance, so I had an idea about what to expect from his style. Sure enough, reading &amp;quot;A Princess of Mars&amp;quot; felt like a taking a trip down memory's lane, back when it was easy to tell who the good and the bad guys were, and there was always a damsel in distress somewhere waiting to be rescued. I have to confess that it took me a few chapters to get re-acclimated with this style, but once I got into it, it was easy reading, which is exactly what I was looking for any how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Carter, the main character, shows all the expected, cliché virtues one would expect from a &amp;quot;hero&amp;quot; but one thing that bothered me a bit was the language he used to describe those who were different from him (which was mostly everyone in the story, since they were all Martians) and the way he treated them. It felt a bit abusive and even a but racist? I don't know if someone could get away with writing in the same style today, but then again I remembered that back then people were not as politically correct as we are today... or maybe I was reading too much into it? Anyhow, it was a fun read and I think I will try to add the next 4 books of the series in the coming months so that I can hopefully get a better opinion formed about the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Vidas+Secas"&gt;Vidas Secas&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Graciliano+Ramos"&gt;Graciliano Ramos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first time reading Graciliano Ramos but I knew about this book from other folks who read it growing up for school. This is the story about how Fabiano, Vitoria, their two small children, &amp;quot;baleia&amp;quot; (whale) the dog and a parrot find themselves fighting for their lives (the parrot is not so lucky and quickly becomes dinner before the end of the first chapter) as they wonder one of the most desolate and arid regions of Brazil, in search for a job and a chance for survival. The characters are presented one by one, as the author allows us a glimpse of their lives and most inner thoughts (or lack of) as if seen from their own eyes. Their lack of communication skills (they mostly understand each other through grunts and gestures), poverty (all Vitoria wants is a bed that doesn't have a wood slat with a big knot in the middle which forces her to sleep sideways and in a fetal position) and failed ambitions as well as how fragile and dependent on the weather (no rain means no water for the farm animals and therefore no job security for Fabiano) their lives are reminded me a lot of &amp;quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a window into what it was like to be poor in the Northeastern region of Brazil at the turn of last century and I wonder how much of it may still be true nowadays?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Cannery+Row"&gt;Cannery Row&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=John+Steinbeck"&gt;John Steinbeck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great book by the master! I read this book while enjoying a much needed vacation with my family, and I couldn't have chosen a better book. Though the plot itself may look a bit too simple at a glance to interest anyone who is not familiar with Steinbeck, he more than makes up for it by providing a nice list of colorful characters, places (a whorehouse named &amp;quot;Bear Flag Restaurant&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Palace Flophouse&amp;quot; where Mac and possibly leader of a small group of vagrants) and events that take place along &amp;quot;cannery row&amp;quot;, a street lined with shabby stores that mostly cater to those who work and earn their living from the many sardine canneries in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed reading about each one of the characters and how Stenibeck, masterfully as always, brings them all together in a party to end all parties! I was often reminded of another one of his books, &amp;quot;Tortilla Flat&amp;quot;, which I also strongly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Neverwhere"&gt;Neverwhere&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Neil+Gaiman"&gt;Neil Gaiman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never read &amp;quot;Neverwhere&amp;quot; the first time it was published in the late 1990s and had zero knowledge about its plot, so I had the advantage of reading this &amp;quot;for the first time&amp;quot; while sipping drinks by the North Carolina coast :) This story has a bit of everything: angels, demons, wild beasts, hunters, warriors, talking mice and a common Londoner named Richard Mayhew, who find himself the unwilling rescuer and then adventure partner of Door (yes, that is her name), the remaining member of a family from Neverwhere. To go back to his old life, he must help Door escape from two demoniacal assassins and find out the truth about the murder of her family. Entertaining and, in my humble opinion, another good example of why Neil Gaiman deserves a spot amongst the best sci-fi writers ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Zen+and+the+Art+of+Motorcycle+Maintenance:+An+Inquiry+Into+Values"&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Robert+M.+Pirsig"&gt;Robert M. Pirsig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was with a bit of trepidation that I started this book, being that there was a lot of hype about it and the assumptions I had made from this hype and what the 'Zen' part of its title implied. My concern being that I didn't want to set myself for disappointment if the book didn't live up to the (very) high expectations I had. I must say, this book is very dense and it was not an easy read... for me at least. Intermingled with the story of the father-son duo traveling through several states on their way West, there are many inner monologues where we learn A LOT about ancient philosophy and how the relentless pursuit of understanding Quality and Truth by the father affected his life and those around him. I had to make a point of finding a quiet place AND a quiet time to read this book just in order to keep up with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that to categorize this book and give it a &amp;quot;grade&amp;quot; without the benefit of having enough time to thoroughly &amp;quot;digest&amp;quot; it is a nearly impossible task to achieve, but the one thing I can say is that I feel that I learned a lot more about philosophy than I thought I was able to, mostly because of the way ideas and terms were described by the author. I also enjoyed how the relationship between father and son was developed and how it all came together in the end, by which time I was reading as fast as I could, barely able to contain my curiosity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is &amp;quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&amp;quot; for the 'faint of heart'? Probably not. I think that the analogy where wines get better with age is applicable here, where you, the reader, is the 'wine' and you must be at a later time in your life to truly be able to grasp what this book is all about. I may be giving it another go later on just to see what other things I may find, once I give myself enough time to (hopefully) grow wiser and have more 'miles' to show for. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+Lottery:+And+Other+Stories"&gt;The Lottery: And Other Stories&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Shirley+Jackson"&gt;Shirley Jackson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two main reasons why I decided to read this book: 1) I read &amp;quot;We Have Always Lived in the Castle&amp;quot; this month and was moderately interested in Shirley Jackson's style, and 2) I heard about the story &amp;quot;The Lottery&amp;quot; from my wife, which only helped peak my curiosity. So I borrowed the book from the public library and went straight to &amp;quot;The Lottery&amp;quot;, which happens to be the very last story in the book. This story gave me, once again, a good taste for her ability to describe places, characters, and what may seem at fist a very mundane scene and... WHAMMO, hit you with a plot twist that catches you unaware and gasping for air. &amp;quot;This book should be a thrilling roller-coaster ride,&amp;quot; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, to be honest I felt that &amp;quot;The Lottery&amp;quot; was by far the darkest of the whole lot. The rest of the other stories, for the most part, were very well thought out, organized and with a plot twist in the end, but the surprises were of a different type: they leave you wondering if you missed something and the questions &amp;quot;what just happened here?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;huh???&amp;quot; were frequently uttered by yours truly as I read the entire book. Most stories do show a hint of weirdness and sometimes the creepiness is very subtle... but just when you think you know where you're headed and you find yourself bracing for the end, she blindfolds you, spins you around 10 times and leaves you in a totally different place, time and with a strange taste in your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think that after all this I would now proclaim that I would never touch one of her stories... but to be honest, I find that I'm even more interested to learn about this author and this style of hers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=We+Have+Always+Lived+in+the+Castle"&gt;We Have Always Lived in the Castle&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Shirley+Jackson"&gt;Shirley Jackson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first Shirley Jackson book and I was a bit confused about her style and if this was perhaps a precursor to what we now call Young Fiction? I think what really threw me off a bit was the 'child-like' language used between Mary Katherine &amp;quot;Merricat&amp;quot; Blackwood and Constance, the two sisters who are the main protagonists in this story, and how it contrasted with the plot itself. Since this book was published in the early 1960s and touches on the topic of human persecution usually experienced when people find you to be &amp;quot;different than the norm&amp;quot;, the dialogues between &amp;quot;Merricat&amp;quot; and the other characters made it all sound like she was a younger girl than she really was (she's supposed to be 18-years-old if I'm not mistaken). There's also a string touch of what I am going to loosely call &amp;quot;weird fiction&amp;quot;, as for instance when she keeps talking to her pet cat as if it were a real person capable of not only understanding her but also making intelligent comments and replies that only she could hear. Or how, despite all the weird things going around them and how they live completely isolated from everyone, everyone in the Blackwood household goes on about their day as if everything was normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I think what really captivated me about this book (and made me go back for more later on) was, funny enough, this mix of dark and weird and I think I also got my first glimpse at the way most of Shirley Jackson's stories end, hanging you out there and wondering &amp;quot;WTF?&amp;quot; :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;July 2015&lt;/strong&gt; I travelled to the &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt; office in &lt;strong&gt;Brno, Czech Republic&lt;/strong&gt; to spend some time with my teammates there, and I managed to get a lot of reading done between long plane rides and being jet lagged for many nights :) So I finally managed to finish up some of the books that had been lingering on my &lt;em&gt;ToDo&lt;/em&gt; list and even managed to finally read a few of the books that together make up the &lt;strong&gt;Chronicles of Narnia&lt;/strong&gt;, since I had never read them as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;

S. Lewis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all the books I read this month, I feel that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=All+Quiet+on+the+Western+Front"&gt;All Quiet on the Western Front&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+October+Country"&gt;The October Country&lt;/a&gt; were the ones I enjoyed reading the most, closely followed by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Cryptonomicon"&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/a&gt;, which took me a while to get through. The other books, with the exception of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+Memoirs+of+Sherlock+Holmes"&gt;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&lt;/a&gt;, helped me pass the time when I only wanted to be entertained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=All+Quiet+on+the+Western+Front"&gt;All Quiet on the Western Front&lt;/a&gt; takes the prize for being one of the best books I have ever read! I felt that the way &lt;strong&gt;WWI&lt;/strong&gt; was presented through the eyes of the main character was a great way to represent all the pain, angst and suffering that all sides of conflict went through, without catering for any particular side or having an agenda. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Erich+Maria+Remarque"&gt;Erich Maria Remarque&lt;/a&gt;'s style had me some times breathless, some times with a knot on the pit of my stomach I as 'endured' the many life changing events that took place in the book. Is this an action-packed book about WWI? Will it read like a thriller? In my opinion, even though there are many chapters with gory details about killings and battles, the answer is a very bland 'maybe'. I think that the real 'star' of this book is its philosophical view of the war and how the main characters, all around 19-20 years of age, learn to deal with its life lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I have been a huge fan of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Ray+Bradbury"&gt;Ray Bradbury&lt;/a&gt; for a while now, and when I got &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+October+Country"&gt;The October Country&lt;/a&gt; for my birthday last month, I just knew that it would be time well spent reading it. For those of you who are more acquainted his science fiction works, this book will surprise you as it shows you a bit of  his 'darker' side. All of the short stories included in this collection deal with death, mysterious apparitions, inexplicable endings and are sure to spook you a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Cryptonomicon"&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/a&gt; was at times slow, some other times funny and, especially toward the end, a very entertaining book. Weighing in at a hefty 1000 pages (depending on the edition you have, plus/minus 50 odd pages), this book covers two different periods in the lives of a number of different characters, past (around &lt;strong&gt;WWII&lt;/strong&gt;) and present, all different threads eventually leading to a great finale. Alternating between past and present, the story takes us to the early days of how &lt;strong&gt;cryptology&lt;/strong&gt; was 'officially invented' and used during the war, and how many of the events that took place back then were affecting the lives of some of the direct descendants of the main characters in our present day. As you go through the back and forth you start to gather bits and pieces of information that eventually connects all the dots of an interesting puzzle. It definitely requires a long term commitment to go though it, but it was enjoyable and, as I mention before, it made me laugh at many places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verdict is still out for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Armada"&gt;Armada&lt;/a&gt;, maybe because I had very high expectations for it after reading &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Ready+Player+One"&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/a&gt; last December. You still see a ton of references to the 80s but the main focus seems to be dedicated to videogames, old and new, and how the main character, Zach Lightman, learns that all the numerous hours he spent in front of his computer pays off when a bunch of aliens one day decide to visit Earth with not so friendly intentions. The book reads a lot like &lt;strong&gt;Enders Game&lt;/strong&gt;, which I didn't quite enjoy to be honest. I just can't relate to books where the main character is a very young and immature person who all of a sudden has these 'mad skills' that puts them in a position to take charge of whole armies! Now, I understand that this is a work of science fiction and that it is not supposed to match reality, etc, etc, and I tried to keep this in mind all the while I read the book. But things happened way too quickly and without having more information (chapters?) showing how a kid who &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; plays videogames 'for a living' can acquire the skills and experience required to get to where he got, the whole story felt too... artificial? Anyhow, even with all these issues I still managed to enjoy the book, mostly because of the 80s references. I gave it 3 (out of 5) starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reading"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=S"&gt;S&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=J.+J.+Abrams"&gt;J. J. Abrams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Fluent+Python"&gt;Fluent Python&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Luciano+Ramalho"&gt;Luciano Ramalho&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=S"&gt;S&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Fluent+Python"&gt;Fluent Python&lt;/a&gt; are books that I have been chipping away for close to two months now... the real reason why it is taking me a while to get through them is two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=S"&gt;S&lt;/a&gt; reads like a huge puzzle/detective board game and it really requires a lot of work to get through. For every actual page of story, there are dozens of messages and notes scribbled on the side and in the margins which, once you put them together, should guide you to the solution of a mystery hidden underneath it all. It is slow reading, and since I usually read to relax after a long day of work, I find myself shying away from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Fluent+Python"&gt;Fluent Python&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt; technical book. I use &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt; at work. See my point above about reading to relax :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bought"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bought&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself with about US$100 left in credits for my &lt;strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/strong&gt; account, which is always dangerous with me... and to make things 'worse', two promising books were released this July 14th: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Go+Set+a+Watchman"&gt;Go Set a Watchman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Armada"&gt;Armada&lt;/a&gt;. Up until then I was doing pretty good actually, only buying three used books... but then, on the 14th, BOOM! Since I bought &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Armada"&gt;Armada&lt;/a&gt; I figured I just had to also get &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Ready+Player+One"&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/a&gt; (which I read last December and loved it)... and my &lt;strong&gt;GoodReads&lt;/strong&gt; list happened to be open too, so I went ahead and got &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+War+of+the+End+of+the+World"&gt;The War of the End of the World&lt;/a&gt;, not to mention that I pre-order another book and a magazine!!! However, and I am proud to say this, I still managed to get around US$17 left... which is still very dangerous :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about you? What kind of interesting books have you read this past month???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Books - June 2015" src="https://omaciel.fedorapeople.org/book_review.png" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you who know me know that I am a huge book reader and spend most of my free time reading several books at the same time. One could say that reading is one of my passions, and having wasted so many years after high school completely ignoring this passion (in exchange for spending most of my time trying to learn about &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt;, get an education, a job and, let's be frank, chasing after girls), I decided that something had to be done about it, and starting around 2008 I 'forced' myself to dedicate at least one solid hour of reading &lt;strong&gt;for fun&lt;/strong&gt; every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it funny to say that I had to &lt;strong&gt;force&lt;/strong&gt; myself, but this statement is very much true. Being so used to spending all of my time sitting in front of a computer and getting flooded with information every single minute of the day (IRC, Twitter, Facebook, commit emails, RSS feeds, etc), I found it difficult to 'unplug' and spend time doing nothing but focusing on only one thing. I was so used to multitasking and being constantly bombarded with lots of information that sitting quietly and reading didn't feel very productive to me... sad but true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, after several 'agonizing' months of getting up from my desk and making a point of turning off my cel phone and finding a quiet place somewhere in the building (or at home during the weekends), I finally got into the habit of reading for pleasure. I actually looked forward to these reading periods (imagine that, huh?) and eventually I realized that if I skipped  this 'ritual' even one day, my days felt like they got longer and I felt stressed out and irritable for the remaining of the day. Reading became not only a good habit but my mechanism for relaxing and recharging my energies during the day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this passion and appetite for reading has only gotten bigger, and with time I have to say that it has become a pretty big part of who I am today! In a way I am happy that it took me this long to get back into the habit of reading... I mean, I feel that getting older was an important part of preparing myself so that I could really appreciate &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=John+Steinbeck"&gt;John Steinbeck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Ray+Bradbury"&gt;Ray Bradbury&lt;/a&gt; and the likes of them! Would I have truly appreciated &lt;strong&gt;The Grapes of Wrath&lt;/strong&gt; when I was younger? Perhaps... but it took me around 40 years to get to it and I'm happy that when it did I was able to appreciate this amazing piece of art!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These last few months I decided that I wanted to start tracking all the books that I read, buy or receive as a gift every month (see my reading progress on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12048315-og-maciel"&gt;GoodReads&lt;/a&gt; and add me as a friend), and jot down some of my impressions and motives for reading or buying them. Those familiar with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Nick+Hornby"&gt;Nick Hornby&lt;/a&gt; will probably associate this post (and hopefully others that will surely come) with the work he has done writing for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.believermag.com/"&gt;Believer Magazine&lt;/a&gt; ... and this would be correct. My intention is not to copy his style or anything like that, but I thought that the format he chose to report on his own reading 'adventures' would fit in quite nicely with what I wanted to get across to my readers... and I'm sticking with the format as long as it works for me :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since June was a very busy book buying/getting month for me (mostly because it was my birthday and I used that as an excuse to go overboard and get lots of books), here is my summary for everything that happened on the reading front. By the way, if you want to get me a book from my &lt;strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://amzn.com/w/32BX7VP2GEFI1"&gt;Wish List&lt;/a&gt;, by all means, do so :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="read"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Read&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Wise+Blood"&gt;Wise Blood&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Flannery+O'Connor"&gt;Flannery O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+Open+Organization"&gt;The Open Organization&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Jim+Whitehurst"&gt;Jim Whitehurst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to last month (and I did write a post about it, but only in Portuguese), it may look like I didn't get a lot of reading done in June, but that is not quite true. Further down you'll see that I've been reading a pretty thick book with around 910 pages &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;, as usual, I am also reading several books at the same time... and did not finish them before the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+Open+Organization"&gt;The Open Organization&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Jim+Whitehurst"&gt;Jim Whitehurst&lt;/a&gt;, current CEO for &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt; (where I work since 2011), I got when the book was launched a few weeks ago. The reason why I chose to put it at the top of my reading list had nothing to do with the fact that it was written by my boss' boss :) but mostly because it talked about certain topics which are very close to my personal interests. The topics discussed are not necessarily new to me, but they are part of my day-to-day routine and I get to practice a lot of them every day. The concept of &lt;strong&gt;meritocracy&lt;/strong&gt; is embedded into the DNA of everyone who works at &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt; and it was very interesting to see how this culture affected and shaped &lt;strong&gt;Jim Whitehurst&lt;/strong&gt;'s career when he joined this company after joining us from &lt;strong&gt;Delta&lt;/strong&gt;. The cultural shock through which he went through reminded me of a similar experience I had when I moved to North Carolina and joined &lt;strong&gt;rPath&lt;/strong&gt;. Many of the names cited throughout the book are people that I have met and worked with in the past almost 4 years, which lent to the reading experience a feeling of closeness and being part of a bigger entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Wise+Blood"&gt;Wise Blood&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Flannery+O'Connor"&gt;Flannery O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; was recommended by my wife, and since I had already read other stories by &lt;strong&gt;Flannery O'Connor&lt;/strong&gt; (and was deeply impressed with the very story I read, &lt;strong&gt;A Good Man is Hard to Find&lt;/strong&gt;) I figured that it was a good opportunity to read a bit more of her stories. As in most of the her previous work (that I read), there is a very strong theme around religion present that permeates and affects, not always in a positive manner, her characters. The scenery and characters are also based in the southern region of the United States, and it's really amazing how well she manages to capture the essence of the south! Unfortunately I felt that the book's plot didn't always make a lot of sense, oftentimes with events that did not seem to add anything to the main story and characters that simply disappeared from the book without a trace or impact on the story itself. It was only after I took some time to research a bit that I learned that this book seems to have been made by several other stories that the author wrote earlier in her career, and were &amp;quot;hammered&amp;quot; together to create a book. Anyway, I recommend this writer if you haven't already read her, and I strongly recommend &lt;strong&gt;A Good Man is Hard to Find&lt;/strong&gt; for being very &amp;quot;dark&amp;quot; and a perfect example of her style!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I barely touched in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+Memoirs+of+Sherlock+Holmes"&gt;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&lt;/a&gt; this month, especially since, as I said in a previous article, I was not impressed with the stories and found them to be mostly super dull. Let's see if I will finish it ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Luciano+Ramalho"&gt;Luciano Ramalho&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Fluent+Python"&gt;Fluent Python&lt;/a&gt; was another that I barely opened, but for much different reasons. The problem was finding free time to read a technical book, after spending the entire month solving problems at work. All my spare time was spent reading things that relaxed me and I made a great effort to disconnect myself from any issues that were related to work. But the book is great and I'll finish it for sure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Cryptonomicon"&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/a&gt; is the book that I mentioned before to be huge (910 pages in the edition I have) and has taken much of my reading time. I usually read it at night and before going to bed. The story is very interesting and it is easy to see why so many people suggest it for those who love science fiction. Mixing a little history of &lt;strong&gt;World War II&lt;/strong&gt;, with characters from real life, and technologies that are part of our life today, I have read this book slowly, enjoying each chapter and revelations. I'm almost on page 600 :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=S"&gt;S&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=J.+J.+Abrams"&gt;J. J. Abrams&lt;/a&gt; has been the most difficult book to read! Not that it is annoying (as &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+Memoirs+of+Sherlock+Holmes"&gt;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&lt;/a&gt;) but it requires a lot of time and &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; to read it. Let me explain. The book has a very interesting story about a person who one day finds himself in a completely strange place... with his clothes soaked with seawater ... and with amnesia! But throughout the book, the margins of the pages are completely filled with comments and handwritten messages (pen, pencil, etc.). When you start reading these messages, you discover that two complete strangers (both for us, the readers, but also among themselves) began communicating casually leaving 'messages' on the margins of this book, which they borrow and return to the local library every time they want to get a response from the other. As you start reading these scribbled messages you then discover that the story described in the book may be a coded message to explain the strange life and eventual disappearance of its author. Roughly at every 10 pages you find loose notes purported to have been left by the two people who are communicating in the margins of the book, copies of documents, letters or newspapers that serve as clues and evidence that were found by them trying to unravel the mystery. For each page that you read from the book itself, you spend almost as much time reading the comments and loose papers. Super cool but a lot of work to read ;)&lt;/p&gt;

read and spent so much time with this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in January of 2014 I set out to read 30 books as part of my
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/1914-2014-reading-challenge"&gt;Reading
Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.
I wanted to focus on reading Brazilian authors early on as I felt that I
really needed to learn more about Brazilian literature and this time,
read books for fun and not because I was told to back when I was much
younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="books 1" src="http://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8561/15972365217_fa019a4c47_n.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took advantage that &lt;strong&gt;UNC&lt;/strong&gt; has a vast books collection with a very
decent section on Brazilian authors and I was able to read some really
awesome books by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3376364.Erico_Verissimo"&gt;Erico
Verissimo&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/191653.Joaquim_Manuel_de_Macedo"&gt;Joaquim Manuel de
Macedo&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/540628.Jos_de_Alencar"&gt;José de
Alencar&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/52683.Jorge_Amado"&gt;Jorge
Amado&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22458.Machado_de_Assis"&gt;Machado de
Assis&lt;/a&gt;!
I also fell in love with these authors and the fact that it took me a
couple of decades to truly appreciate them doesn't bother me at all,
since I believe that it took me this long to reach the right maturity
level... in other words, I was not ready for them yet until this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="books 2" src="http://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7536/16132335406_f5bdfa631b_n.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also fell in love with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/585.John_Steinbeck"&gt;John
Steinbeck&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1630.Ray_Bradbury"&gt;Ray
Bradbury&lt;/a&gt;,
and I think that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114322-the-grapes-of-wrath"&gt;Grapes of
Wrath&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50033.Dandelion_Wine"&gt;Dandelion
Wine&lt;/a&gt; are
two of the best books I have ever read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, 2014 was also the year I started reading short stories (to
sample different authors and see what they 'have to offer'), and I
highly recommend the short stories of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22694.Flannery_O_Connor"&gt;Flannery
O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7464.John_Cheever"&gt;John
Cheever&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/158635.Simon_Rich"&gt;Simon
Rich&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13450.Gabriel_Garc_a_M_rquez"&gt;Gabriel Garcí­a
Márquez&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="books 3" src="http://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7526/16132335446_ecd062b9bd_n.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015 I plan to continue reading more Brazilian authors and exploring
different authors and genres! I may even re-read &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33.The_Lord_of_the_Rings"&gt;The Lord of the
Rings&lt;/a&gt;
again. :)&lt;/p&gt;

career: today is my 3-year anniversary at Red Hat! Time has certainly
flown by and I really cannot believe that it has been three years since
I joined this company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it is sort of cliche to say &amp;quot;I can not believe that it has been
this long...&amp;quot; and so on and so forth, but it is so true. Back then I
joined a relatively new project with very high ambitions, and the first
few months had me swimming way out in the deepest part of the pool,
trying to learn all 'Red Hat-things' and &lt;strong&gt;Clojure&lt;/strong&gt; for the existing
automation framework (now we are fully using &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a lot of swimming for sure, and through the next months, through
many long days and weekends and hard work, tears and sweat (you know,
your typical life for a &lt;strong&gt;Quality Engineer&lt;/strong&gt; worth his/her salt), I
succeeded in adding &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; wearing many types of hats, going from a
&lt;strong&gt;Senior Quality Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;, to a &lt;strong&gt;Supervisor&lt;/strong&gt; of the team, to
eventually becoming the &lt;strong&gt;Manager&lt;/strong&gt; for a couple of teams, spread over 4
different countries. Am I bragging? Maaaybe a little bit :) but my point
is really to highlight a major key factor that made this rapid ascension
path possible: Red Hat's work philosophy and culture of rewarding those
who work hard and truly embrace the company! Sure, I worked really hard,
but I have worked just as hard before in previous places and gotten
nowhere really fast! Being recognized and rewarded for your hard work is
something new to me, and I owe a great debt of gratitude to those who
took the time to acknowledge my efforts and allowed me room to grow
within this company!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part of being a Red Hatter for 3 years? Being surrounded by an
enormous pool of talented, exciting people who not only enjoy what they
do, but are always willing to teach you something new, and/or to drop
what they're working on to lend you a helping hand! There is not a
single day that I don't learn something new, and thankfully I don't see
any sign of this trend stopping :) Have I mentioned that I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; my
teammates too? What a great bunch of guys!!! Getting up early in the
morning and walking to my home office (yeah, they let me work remotely
too) day in, day out, is never a drag because I just know that there are
new things to learn and new adventures and 'achievements to unlock'
right around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am Red Hat!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

section of &lt;strong&gt;The New York Times&lt;/strong&gt; while drinking my coffee. This has
become sort of a 'tradition' for me and because of it I have been able
to learn about many interesting books, some of which I would not have
found out on my own. I also 'blame' this activity to turning my
nightstand into a mini-library on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I have the following books waiting for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="Lolita"&gt;Lolita&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, while drinking my coffee this morning I realized just how much I
enjoy reading and (what I like to call) catching up with all the books I
either read when I was younger but took for granted or finally getting
to those books that have been so patiently waiting for me to get to
them. And now, whenever I'm not working or with my kids, you can bet
your bottom dollar that you'll find me somewhere outside (when the
mosquitos are not buzzing about the yard) or cozily nestled with a book
(or two) somewhere quiet around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to the point of this story, today I realized that, if I could go
back in time (which reminds me, I should probably add &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2493.The_Time_Machine?ac=1"&gt;The Time
Machine&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;
to my list) to the days when I was looking to buy a house, I would have
done two things differently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wire the entire house so that every room would have a couple of
ethernet ports;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chosen a house with a large-ish room and add wall-to-wall bookcases,
like you see in those movies where a well-off person takes their
guests into their private libraries for tea and biscuits;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that I can't change the past, and I also realize that perhaps
it is a good thing that I took my book reading for granted during my
high school and university years... I don't think I would have enjoyed
reading &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50033.Dandelion_Wine?ac=1"&gt;Dandelion
Wine&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14942.Mrs_Dalloway?from_search=true"&gt;Mrs.
Dalloway&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;
as much back then as I when I finally did. I guess reading books is very
much like the process of making good wines... with age and experience,
the reader, not the book, develops the maturity and ability to properly
savor a good story.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Og Maciel</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2014 12:07:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:omaciel.github.io,2014-09-21:books.html</guid><category>books</category><category>life</category></item><item><title>The End For Pylyglot</title><link>https://omaciel.github.io/the-end-for-pylyglot.html</link><description>&lt;div class="section" id="background"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was around 2005 when I started doing translations for Free and
Open-Source Software. Back then I was warmly welcomed to the Ubuntu
family and quickly learned all there was to know about using their
Rosetta online tool to translate and/or review existing translations for
the Brazilian Portuguese language. I spent so much time doing it, even
during working hours, that eventually I sort of &amp;quot;made a name for myself&amp;quot;
and made my way up to the upper layers of the Ubuntu Community echelon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I &amp;quot;graduated&amp;quot; and started doing translations for the upstream
projects, such as GNOME, Xfce, LXDE, and Openbox. I took on more
responsabilities, learned to use Git and make commits for myself as well
as for other contributors, and strived to unify all Brazilian Portuguese
translations across as many different projects as possible. Many
discussions were had, (literally) hundreds of hours were spent going
though also hundreds of thoundands of translations for hundreds of
different applications, none of it bringing me any monetary of financial
advantage, but all done for the simple pleasure of knowing that I was
helping make FOSS applications &amp;quot;speak&amp;quot; Brazilian Portuguese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly learned a lot though the experience of working on these many
projects... some times I made mistakes, other times I &amp;quot;fought&amp;quot; alone to
make sure that standards and procedures were complied with. All in all,
looking back I only have one regret: not being nominated to become the
leader for the Brazilian GNOME translation team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having handled 50% of the translations for one of the GNOME releases
(the other 50% was handled by a good friend, Vladimir Melo while the
leader did nothing to help) and spent much time making sure that the
release would go out the door 100% translated, I really thought I'd be
nominated to become the next leader. Not that I felt that I needed a
'title' to show off to other people, but in a way I wanted to feel that
my peers acknowledged my hard work and commitment to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing other people, even people with no previous experience, being
nominated by the current leader to replace him was a slap in the face.
It really hurt me... but I made sure to be supportive and continue to
work just as hard. I guess you could say that I lived and breathed
translations, my passion not knowing any limits or knowing when to
stop...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But stop I eventually did, several years ago, when I realized how hard
it was to land a job that would allow me to support my family (back then
I had 2 small kids) and continue to do the thing I cared the most. I
confess that I even went through a series of job interviews for the
translation role that Jono Bacon, Canonical's former community manager,
was trying to hire, but in the end things didn't work out the way I
wanted. I also flirted with another similar role at MeeGo but since they
wanted me to move to the West Coast I decided not to pursue it (I also
had fallen in love with my then current job).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pylyglot"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pylyglot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a way to keep myself somewhat still involved with the translation
communities and at the same time learn a bit more about the Django
framework, I then created &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pylyglot.org"&gt;Pylyglot&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;a web
based glossary compedium for Free and Open Source Software translators
heavily inspired on the Open-tran.eu web site... with the objective to
'provide a concise, yet comprehensive compilation of a body of
knowledge' for translators derived from existing Free and Open Source
Software translations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Pylyglot" src="/images/pylyglot.png" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been running this service on my own and paying for the cost of
domain registration and database costs out of my own pocket for a while
now, and I now find myself facing the dilema of renewing the domain
registration and keep Pylyglot alive for another year... or retire it
and end once and for all my relationship with FOSS translations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent the last couple of months thinking about it, I have now
arrived at the conclusion that it is time to let this chapter of my life
rest. Though the US$140/year that I won't be spending won't make me any
richer, I don't foresee myself either maintaining or spending any time
improving the project. So this July 21st, 2014 Pylyglot will close its
doors and cease to exist in its current form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those who knew about Pylyglot and used it and, hopefuly, found it to
be useful, my sincere thanks for using it. To those who supported my
idea and the project itself, whether by submitting code patches,
building the web site or just giving me moral support, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

and when our plane finally landed after the almost 10 1/2 hours flight
and we made our way to the luggage claim area, the reunion was filled
with a lot of hugging, laughter and a huge sigh of relief. For someone
who had spent most of their entire lives in a small and sleepy town in
the East coast of &lt;strong&gt;Brazil&lt;/strong&gt;, waking up and finding yourself at &lt;strong&gt;JFK
Airport&lt;/strong&gt; was nothing short of a major event! I had never seen so many
people of so many different races and speaking so many different
dialects in my entire life, all 16 years of them! Everywhere I looked,
everything was so different from what I was used to… even signs (so many
of them) were in a different language! Eventually we grabbed our luggage
and made our way to the parking lot looking for our car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before my sister and I left Brazil, I had the very hard task of giving
away all of my possessions and only bringing the very bare minimal to
start “a new life”. I was still going through my mid-teenager years, so
I had to give away all of my favorite music LPs, books, childhood toys,
and all the mementos I had collected through the years. This may not be
such a big deal to you, but I have always been very attached to the
things people give me, specially if they were given by someone I really
cared. Seeing the things that represented so many people and moments of
my life slowly drifting away filled me with a great feeling of personal
loss. This feeling would stay with me for the next couple of years as I
tried to adjust to my new adopted country. I was a stranger in a
different land, where nobody knew me and I did not know anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been &lt;strong&gt;23 years&lt;/strong&gt; since this event took place, and I’m still here
in the “Land of the Free”. Through the years I have survived High
School, graduated with a Bachelors in Science from an university in
Upstate New York, married (another immigrant from another country who
you shall meet soon), moved a couple of times, and now find myself
raising three young girls in &lt;strong&gt;North Carolina&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;first Maciel
generation&lt;/strong&gt; of our families to be born outside our countries! Our
similarities and differences, however, go beyond only the generation
gap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, contrary to a lot of the “stereotypical” immigrant families, we
have completely immersed ourselves into the &lt;strong&gt;Americal way of life and
culture&lt;/strong&gt;, with a dash of our childhood cultures sprinkled here and
there to add a little diversity to the mix. My wife and I stopped
observing the holidays from our countries of origin a long time ago,
specially those with no corresponding holidays here. We share a lot of
the things that we learned growing up with our kids, but always in a
nostalgic, almost didactic sort of way. We speak a mix of &lt;strong&gt;Brazilian
Portuguese-Mexican Spanish-New Jersey English&lt;/strong&gt; at home and try our best
not to force our children to learn either language in particular. As it
stands now, our kids’ primary language is English and even though I
still make a habit of speaking in Brazilian Portuguese to them, their
vocabulary consists of several words that they only say either in
Spanish or Portuguese, like the word “daddy”. My wife’s vocabulary has
also gone through a very interesting transformation, and &lt;strong&gt;she now
speaks more Portuguese than Spanish&lt;/strong&gt; when talking to our kids. Maybe it
is because she was very young when she moved to New York in the early
1990s and never really got a lot of exposure to the Spanish language
growing up in a different country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I can say is that &lt;strong&gt;I call North Carolina home&lt;/strong&gt;, I vote during
elections, I always get emotional when hearing the American Anthem, and
together with my wife I raise the next generation of the Maciel family!
Maybe they will take some of our culture and teach it to their own kids
one day… maybe one day they may even learn to speak Portuguese or
Spanish… maybe they won’t, and that is ok by me. We don’t even force
them to follow the same religion our parents (and their parents) taught
us growing up, prefering that they make that decision on their own, when
and if they’re ever interested in doing so. We want them to be able to
choose their own paths and make educated decisions about every aspect of
their lives without any pressure or guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m an &lt;strong&gt;American-Brazilian&lt;/strong&gt;, my wife is &lt;strong&gt;American-Mexican&lt;/strong&gt; and our
kids are Americans with a touch of Brazilian and Mexican pride and
culture. Together we form the &lt;strong&gt;New American Family&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

encountered last night before going to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the new &amp;quot;Lorem Ipsum&amp;quot; generator was not honoring the
&lt;strong&gt;words&lt;/strong&gt; parameter if you asked for a string longer than 70 characters.
I have fixed the issue as well as added a new test to make sure that the
generator does the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package is available on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fauxfactory/0.2.0"&gt;Pypi&lt;/a&gt; (sadly the
page is &lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt; not rendering correctly... suggestions welcome) and
can be installed via &lt;strong&gt;pip install fauxfactory&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any constructive feedback, suggestions, or file a bug report
or feature request, please use the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/omaciel/fauxfactory"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;

Ipsum&amp;quot; generator. I confess that I did not look around for any existing
implementation in python out there and just started writing code. My
idea was to create a method that would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return a &amp;quot;Lorem Ipsum&amp;quot; string if I passed no arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;fauxfactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FauxFactory&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FauxFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;generate_iplum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;u'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;eiusmod&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tempor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;incididunt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;labore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;et&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dolore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;magna&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;aliqua&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Ut&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;enim&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ad&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;minim&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;veniam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;quis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nostrud&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exercitation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ullamco&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;laboris&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nisi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;aliquip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ea&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;commodo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;consequat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Duis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;aute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;irure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dolor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;reprehenderit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;voluptate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;velit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;esse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cillum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dolore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;eu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fugiat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nulla&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;pariatur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Excepteur&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;occaecat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cupidatat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;non&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;proident&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sunt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;culpa&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;qui&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;officia&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;deserunt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mollit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;anim&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;est&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;laborum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return a single paragraph with a fixed number of words if I passed a
numeric &lt;strong&gt;words=x&lt;/strong&gt; argument. If &lt;strong&gt;words&lt;/strong&gt; was a large number, the text
would 'wrap around' as many times as needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FauxFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;generate_iplum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;u'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;reprehenderit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;voluptate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;velit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;esse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cillum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dolore&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;eu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fugiat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nulla&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;strong&gt;paragraphs=x&lt;/strong&gt; was used, then a given number of paragraphs
containing the entire &amp;quot;Lorem Ipsum&amp;quot; string is returned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;occaecat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cupidatat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;non&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;proident&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sunt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;culpa&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;qui&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;officia&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;deserunt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;mollit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;anim&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;est&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;laborum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if both &lt;strong&gt;words&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;paragraphs&lt;/strong&gt; are used, then a given
number of paragraphs with the specified number of words is returned,
with the text 'flowing' and 'wrapping around' as needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FauxFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;generate_iplum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;paragraphs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;u'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing.'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FauxFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;generate_iplum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;paragraphs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;u'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Elit,&lt;/span&gt;

team here at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.redhat.com"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt; since last &lt;strong&gt;November,
2013&lt;/strong&gt;... and believe it or not, so far I've had absolutely zero success
in finding good, strong, with real world experience candidates in North
Carolina! I either find really smart people, who do have relevant
backgrounds or could 'hit the ground running' but are way out of my
current budget, or they lack real world experience and fall into more of
an entry level position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically I'm looking for someone who not only can 'speak python'
fluently but also has experience doing automation and writing tests, as
well as that 'QE mindset' that makes you want to automate all things and
question all things about a product! Someone who knows how to file a
good bug report and knows how to provide pertinent, relevant information
to developers so that they can fix a bug. Finally, someone who believes
in continuous integration and is excited about an opportunity to improve
and augment our existing testing
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/omaciel/robottelo"&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt; and work with a
very exciting product, knowing that your contributions will affect
literally thousands of customers world wide!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus points if you know what &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/"&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt;
is and have played with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.lag.net/paramiko/"&gt;Paramiko&lt;/a&gt;
and/or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/"&gt;Requests&lt;/a&gt;!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does that interest you? Feel that you got what I'm looking for? Then
take a peek at these two positions and apply fast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; This is more of a note for myself than a proper
tutorial or howto, so I make no promises that this will work for you.
The setup used through this post was a Mac OS laptop upgraded to the
very latest version of the OS.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started doing &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt; development using &lt;strong&gt;Emacs&lt;/strong&gt;, I
have unsuccessfully tried to configure
&lt;strong&gt;`Rope &amp;lt;http://rope.sourceforge.net/&amp;gt;`__,&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;a python refactoring
library&amp;quot;…&amp;nbsp;until last Friday. Turns out I wasn’t too far off the mark
during the many iterations I went through to get it done, but the
following post was tremendously helpful to
me:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2010/05/my-emacs-python-environment/"&gt;http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2010/05/my-emacs-python-environment/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what worked for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;strong&gt;Pymacs&lt;/strong&gt; (Emacs part):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pinard/Pymacs/tarball/v0.2"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; latest
(0.25 as of the writing of this post)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cd to the source code directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mkdir ~/.emacs.d/vendor/pymacs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cp pymacs.el&amp;nbsp;~/.emacs.d/vendor/pymacs/pymacs.el&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pinard/Pymacs/tarball/v0.25"&gt;emacs -batch -eval ‘(byte-compile-file
“~/.emacs.d/vendor/pymacs/pymacs.el”)’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pinard/Pymacs/tarball/v0.25"&gt;Install Pymacs
(&lt;/a&gt;Python part):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sudo pip install
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pinard/Pymacs/tarball/v0.2"&gt;https://github.com/pinard/Pymacs/tarball/v0.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ropemacs&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;strong&gt;rope&lt;/strong&gt; with&amp;nbsp;sudo pip install
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bitbucket.org/agr/ropemacs/get/tip.tar.gz"&gt;http://bitbucket.org/agr/ropemacs/get/tip.tar.gz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now configure Emacs by adding the following lines to your init.el file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;(require ‘pymacs)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;(pymacs-load “ropemacs” “rope-“)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;(setq ropemacs-enable-autoimport t)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, start up Emacs and make sure to read this
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/agr/ropemacs"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; for some examples on
how to use Rope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually like to use python to script my day to day tests against
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.katello.org/"&gt;Katello&lt;/a&gt; (you may have seen some of my
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ogmaciel.tumblr.com/post/52170839167/populating-a-katello-instance-using-the-cli"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ogmaciel.tumblr.com/post/29571582261/script-to-populate-a-katello-instance-with-valid-data"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;
about using the Katello CLI for the same purpose) and I figured I’d
start showing some basic examples for anyone else out there who may be
interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have already installed and configured your Katello instance
(learn how to do this
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedorahosted.org/katello/wiki/Install"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) with the
default configurations, we now have a few options to proceed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write and run your scripts in the same environment as your server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/katello-cli/"&gt;katello-cli&lt;/a&gt; package
(&lt;em&gt;pip install katello-cli&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use git to clone the katello-cli
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Katello/katello-cli"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;git
clone&amp;nbsp;https://github.com/Katello/katello-cli.git&lt;/em&gt;) and make sure to
include it into your &lt;strong&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1&lt;/strong&gt; is by far the easiest approach since you should have all
the dependencies (namely &lt;strong&gt;kerberos&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;M2Crypto&lt;/strong&gt;) already
installed, but I like &lt;strong&gt;Option 3&lt;/strong&gt; as it allows me to always have the
latest code to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re ready to write some code! The first thing we’ll do is import
some of the Katello modules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
from katello.client import server
from katello.client.server import BasicAuthentication
from katello.client.api.organization import OrganizationAPI
from katello.client.api.system_group import SystemGroupAPI&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we establish a connection to the Katello server
(&lt;strong&gt;qetello01.example.com&lt;/strong&gt; in my case), using the default credentials of
&lt;strong&gt;admin&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;admin&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
katello_server = server.KatelloServer(host='qetello01.example.com',
path_prefix='/katello/', port=443)
katello_server.set_auth_method(BasicAuthentication(username='admin',
password='admin'))
server.set_active_server(katello_server)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s now instantiate the Organization API object and use it to fetch
the “&lt;strong&gt;ACME_Corporation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; that gets automatically created for a
default installation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;organization_api = OrganizationAPI()&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;org = organization_api.organization('ACME_Corporation')
print&amp;nbsp;org
{u’apply_info_task_id’: None,
u’created_at’: u’2013-09-12T20:15:06Z’,
u’default_info’: {u’distributor’: [], u’system’: []},
u’deletion_task_id’: None,
u’description’: u’ACME_Corporation Organization’,
u’id’: 1,
u’label’: u’ACME_Corporation’,
u’name’: u’ACME_Corporation’,
u’owner_auto_attach_all_systems_task_id’: None,
u’service_level’: None,
u’service_levels’: [],
u’updated_at’: u’2013-09-12T20:15:06Z’}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, let’s create a brand new organization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
new_org = organization_api.create(name='New Org', label='new-org',
description='Created via API')
print new_org
{u’apply_info_task_id’: None,
u’created_at’: u’2013-09-12T21:48:55Z’,
u’default_info’: {u’distributor’: [], u’system’: []},
u’deletion_task_id’: None,
u’description’: u’Created via API’,
u’id’: 283,
u’label’: u’new-org’,
u’name’: u’New Org’,
u’owner_auto_attach_all_systems_task_id’: None,
u’service_level’: None,
u’service_levels’: [],
u’updated_at’: u’2013-09-12T21:48:55Z’}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it is pretty straight forward to use python to create
some useful scripts to drive a Katello server, whether you want to
populate it with a pre-defined set of data (e.g. default users, roles,
permissions, organizations, content, etc) or to test core functionality
as I do with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/omaciel/mangonel"&gt;Mangonel&lt;/a&gt;, my pet
project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/71c0527841d30b80424b"&gt;Gist&lt;/a&gt; of the
code mentioned in this post, and let me know if this was useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Em 2008, depois de algumas discussões sobre o tipo de conteúdo que meu
blog estava gerando em alguns agregadores nacionais, eu tomei a decisāo
de criar meu próprio agregador com o seguinte objetivo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;O&amp;nbsp;**Planeta GNU/Linux*&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;nasceu da minha necessidade de querer ler
blogs de pessoas relacionadas ao movimento Brasileiro de software livre,
mas sem a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;censura bitolada&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;que outros agregadores de blogs usam
para filtrar o conteúdo que é publicado.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;O critério para entrar no Planeta é super simples:&amp;nbsp;**eu tenho de
gostar do material*&lt;/em&gt;! Ao contrário dos outros agregadores que geralmente
são vinculados a comunidades ou distribuições, este site aqui é
completamente independente e sem censura nenhuma!*”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desde entāo eu venho administrando o conteúdo e tentando adicionar
material que seja relevante aos meus interesses e daqueles que também
acompanham este “planeta”. Mas nos últimos 2 anos tanto o meu tempo como
meu interesse por este tipo de fonte de notícias diminuiu bastante e o
projeto ficou meio que jogado às traças… até a semana passada quando
recebi um e-mail me avisando que estava na hora de renovar o meu
domínio. Foi aí que eu resolvi que nāo fazia mais sentido em manter um
projeto que eu nāo tenho mais interesse, e em outubro deste ano o
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://planeta.gnulinuxbrasil.org/"&gt;Planeta GNU/Linux Brasil&lt;/a&gt;
deixará de existir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/13jSmSx"&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; to automatically populate a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.katello.org/"&gt;Katello&lt;/a&gt; server instance with real data (hi
&lt;strong&gt;reyc&lt;/strong&gt;!) I wrote that a while back and though it still does contain
some helpful commands, I figured it was about time I updated it. Well,
it took me longer than I expected to find some time and clean it up, but
I think I can now show you a brand new script which also includes the
extra feature of downloading a manifest file directly from &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt;'s
portal and importing it as part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the script assumes that you have the following information
(either as environmental variables or substituted into the script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RHN_USERNAME&lt;/strong&gt;: A valid username for
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://access.redhat.com/"&gt;https://access.redhat.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RHN_PASSWORD&lt;/strong&gt;: A valid password for
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://access.redhat.com/"&gt;https://access.redhat.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISTRIBUTOR&lt;/strong&gt;: An existing distributor UUID with access to Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6 Server products&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/15Fk4di"&gt;new script&lt;/a&gt; is know to work with the very
&lt;strong&gt;latest Katello nightly build&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have any suggestions or
constructive feedback, feel free to leave me a comment here or fork the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/15Fk4di"&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt; and send me a pull request!&lt;/p&gt;

and occasional grey hairs) some interesting changes on how I manage and
maintain my “digital belongings”. For a long while I used to worry about
backing up and storing in a safe place all the files, photos, books,
movies and music I’ve collected through the years. I have also managed
to collect a variety of different external USB hard drives to keep up
with this digital sprawl, where for each iteration the next device would
increase in size and sometimes in speed compared to the current one. It
got to a point where I got tired of the backup/restore game and found
myself paying less and less attention to the things I had spent so much
time maintaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music was one of the last items that I eventually stopped backing up.
One day last year I took my entire collection of approximately 9000
(legal) songs and uploaded them to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/"&gt;Google
Play&lt;/a&gt;! The very next time I re-installed my
desktop I didn’t have to restore my music collection anymore. All I
needed was a net connection and I was off to listening to my tunes! I
also had full access to that collection via my Android phone and laptop!
Triple yummy! Sure, without net access I would be out of luck, but I
could always keep a smaller subset of my collection around if I wanted
to listen to anything while offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while I noticed that I seldon played my own tunes, often
spending more and more of my music listening minutes on sites such as
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pandora.com/"&gt;Pandora&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://grooveshark.com/"&gt;Grooveshark&lt;/a&gt; to experience new types of
music and genres. At one point I found myself subscribing to Pandora,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rdio.com/"&gt;Rdio&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.spotify.com/"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, looking for what in my opinion
would provide me with the best listening experience. After about a month
I think I have finally found the combination that gets me closer to that
goal: &lt;strong&gt;Pandora&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;Spotify&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little background though. I have been a Pandora (non-paying) customer
for many years now and I can’t say enough about the music quality and
the variety that you can get for this service! I mean, for the
completely FREE option (with the occasional advertisement) you get to
listen to (what feels like to be) hand picked songs that match whatever
criteria you can come up with! Be it a song, a word, an artist or an
album, Pandora’s matching algorithm is by far the best I’ve seen out
there. Period! It is because of this plus the fact that I can access it
from anywhere and any device with net access that I became a paid
customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how about those times when I specifically want to listen to a given
song or album or even make a playlist with some of my favorite jams?
After a while I learned a nice
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mashable.com/2013/04/09/pandora-tips-tricks/"&gt;trick&lt;/a&gt; that
lets you sample an album from Pandora but that wasn’t enough for what I
wanted to do. So Grooveshark was definitely a great find for me and for
a while I really enjoyed the freedom and wide selection that it offered
me for free. Something really simple but it also made a difference for
me was that I could “scrobble” the music I listened to my
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.last.fm/user/OgMaciel"&gt;Last.fm&lt;/a&gt; account, something that
Pandora doesn’t do. But alas, I couldn’t listen to my playlists on the
go or even using my phone, so I started looking for options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Rdio impressed me right away for being exactly what Groveshark was
but with the added capability of being available on multiple platforms,
and including some of the newest and latest releases! The pricing model
was a bit more expensive than Pandora, but it did give me the ability to
create my own playlists and interact with my friends via different
social networks. I definitely enjoyed the experience and would have
stuck with if it wasn’t for the small music collection that is available
right now. I understand that Rdio tries to add as many new (and old)
titles as it can, but at the end of the day, I couldn’t always find what
I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify was the “dark horse” during my experimentation, mostly because
it didn’t offer a first class client for Linux. There was a “half baked”
client out there that never worked for me/or crashed too many times… I
even ran the Windows client via Wine for the first 2-3 weeks but it felt
“dirty” to pay for a service that would not run natively or provide a
decent support for my platform. The Android and iOS apps worked like a
charm, but I spent the bulk of my days in front of a Fedora box and
listening to music from my phone was not going to cut it for me. The
music variety is definitely much larger that what Rdio offers and it
even has its own “Radio” streaming that provides something similar to
what Pandora does. But the matching algorithm is still light-years
behind Pandora and I often found myself wondering how certain songs and
genres ended up in the “station” I was listening to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about a month into the experiment, it looked like I was going to
keep Pandora and Rdio to get great music selection and variety
(Pandora), web front end access and multi-platform support (Pandora,
Rdio), and playlists (Rdio)… until a co-worker mentioned that Spotify
had just announced their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.spotify.com/home"&gt;web based
player&lt;/a&gt;! All of a sudden Spotify went
from being in last place to bumping Rdio out of the equation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Spotify web player" src="http://bit.ly/14NtWo9" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I am using both Pandora and Spotify at home and on the go
(Spotify lets you download your playlists for offline listening) and so
far the experience has definitely been positive. I feel that the
streaming quality and variety has provided me with many enjoyable hours
of music while I work and even my kids have started experimenting with
Pandora as they get more exposure to the musical world. And if I ever
feel like listening to some of my own music, some of which is not yet
found on Spotify, I can always turn to Google Play… and I definitely
enjoy not having to manage my backups anymore. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had one of those “once in a a lifetime” opportunities,
thanks to my wife who dragged me to a presentation hosted by the
University of North Carolina. The presentation by Dr. Eduardo Torres
Cuevas, titled “Preserving Cuba’s Cultural Heritage in the 21st Century”
attracted a small gathering, apparently&amp;nbsp;mostly&amp;nbsp;made up of UNC staff and
students who are currently enrolled in one of their languages courses. I
wasn’t really sure what to expect from it, but being the supportive
husband that I am, I signed off from work a bit earlier and together
with our 2 kids we drove to the main campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire lecture was done in Spanish while a translator tried her best
to keep up with Dr. Cuevas’ detailed and humored style of prose, as he
told us about the history behind Cuba’s National Library. I must tell
you, being a “real time” translator is not an easy task, and though Dr.
Cuevas tried to slow things down so she could do her job in a timely
fashion, she still had to&amp;nbsp;summarize&amp;nbsp;a lot of what was being said in
order to keep up with him. Sadly, a lot of the “good stuff” was never
mentioned and/or was completely lost in translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cuevas was an excellent speaker and was able to quickly put everyone
at ease right away and transport us to the Havana of the 1950s. The
entire lecture lasted approximately 50 minutes but in reality it felt
more like a small fraction of that! I could tell that he is extremely
passionate about preserving the Cuban cultural heritage for posterity,
and together with a strong character and charisma, I dare say that
everyone in attendance was completely captivated by his stories as if in
a trance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let me remind you of one minor detail I mentioned early on that you
may have overlooked: everything was in Spanish, a language which though
not completely unfamiliar to me, is not my first or second language in
order of fluency (Brazilian Portuguese and English in this order if
you’re wondering what my first and second languages are). Sure, there
was a translator, but after the first 3 minutes I completely ignored her
voice and focused completely on Dr. Cuevas. Eventually, the translator’s
voice became white noise or just an annoyance, as we would have to stop
the flow of the lecture in order for her to turn beautiful story
telling-style prose to a short. almost. dry. list. of. facts. and.
numbers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel extremely lucky that I was able to not only meet but hear someone
who may be a very important person in the history of Cuba. I also feel
extremely lucky that I was able to follow and understand the entire
presentation in the “original format” without the need for “caption” or
any other aid. Had I relied solely on translations, I would have never
really gotten all the little jokes, nuances and true meaning behind the
words uttered by the gentleman from Havana… and most likely would not
feel this great urge I now feel to make Cuba, and specially the National
Library of Cuba, my choice for the next time I go anywhere outside the
States for vacation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woke up to the following email this morning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Og Maciel,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations on your one-year anniversary with Red Hat! Thank
you for your commitment and work over the past year. We hope that it
has been everything you expected it to be and look forward to
celebrating your future success with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time sure flies when you’re having too much fun! I can’t believe it’s
been one whole year since I joined &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.redhat.com/"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;
as a &lt;strong&gt;Senior QA Engineer&lt;/strong&gt; to work on their
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.redhat.com/products/cloud-computing/cloudforms/"&gt;CloudForms&lt;/a&gt;
project! So much has happened since then that it is a bit hard to
remember all the new and exciting things I had the pleasure of being a
part of! It is absolutely grate to be able to work on such a cool and
challenging environment, and to experience first hand what open source
and meritocracy really means!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember being asked during my interview process what my long-term
goals were (or something along these lines), and my answer was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;In the next 5 years I want to be the &lt;strong&gt;Go To&lt;/strong&gt; person to all
questions related to &lt;strong&gt;CloudForms&lt;/strong&gt;!”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, one year down and four more to go! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to follow up on my previous
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ogmaciel.tumblr.com/post/36760809108/extending-the-default-ec2-root-partition-for-an"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;
in regards to how to resize the root partition of an EC2 instance. Turns
out that, once you’ve edited the root partition while in the launch
panel, you can then perform the resize command right away, as soon as
the instance is up and running and you have ssh’ed to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:root&amp;#64;ip-aa-bb-cc-dd"&gt;root&amp;#64;ip-aa-bb-cc-dd&lt;/a&gt; ~]# resize2fs /dev/xvde1&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely better than what I thought one had to do to get a
bigger root partition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I was playing with &lt;strong&gt;EC2&lt;/strong&gt;, trying to launch a &lt;strong&gt;RHEL 6.3&lt;/strong&gt;
instance so that I could then install the latest version of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://katello.org"&gt;Katello&lt;/a&gt; and beat a bit on it… just for fun, you
know? Using the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2"&gt;EC2 Management
Console&lt;/a&gt; web interface I used the
“classical” wizard to select all the components I wanted for a
&lt;strong&gt;m1.large&lt;/strong&gt; instance, making sure to edit the default &lt;strong&gt;7.5&amp;nbsp;GB&lt;/strong&gt; root
partition they give you so that I could have more space available to
synchronize content… but when the instance finally came up I realized
that my disk space was still showing the default value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:root&amp;#64;ip-aa-bb-cc-dd"&gt;root&amp;#64;ip-aa-bb-cc-dd&lt;/a&gt; ~]# df -h&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filesystem &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Size &amp;nbsp;Used Avail Use% Mounted on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/dev/xvde1 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;5.7G &amp;nbsp;1.7G &amp;nbsp;4.0G &amp;nbsp;30% /&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;none &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;3.7G &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 0 &amp;nbsp;3.7G &amp;nbsp; 0% /dev/shm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrecked my brain about that for quite some time, retracing my steps
and even terminating my instance and starting from scratch a few times,
thinking that perhaps I had missed an obvious step. Eventually I came
across a few posts online and was able to solve my problem, which I will
try to describe below. Obviously, feel free to read the original posts
for more information. The steps are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once your instance is up and running, stop it selecting the Stop
option from the Management Console window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, switch to the Elastic Block Store section and select your
instance’s volume from the &amp;nbsp;Volumes subsection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detach the selected volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the option to create a snapshot off of the detached volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch to the Snapshot subsection and select the newly created
snapshot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the Create Volume option and create a larger volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to the Volumes subsction, select the newly create volume and
attach it as the root volume for your instance (should be /dev/sda1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart your instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as the instance is back online, ssh to it and verify that the
disk size has not changed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, resize the root partition so that it can “absorb” the larger volume
we created:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:root&amp;#64;ip-aa-bb-cc-dd"&gt;root&amp;#64;ip-aa-bb-cc-dd&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;~]# resize2fs /dev/xvde1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;resize2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filesystem at /dev/xvde1 is mounted on /; on-line resizing required&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;old desc_blocks = 1, new_desc_blocks = 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing an on-line resize of /dev/xvde1 to 20971520 (4k) blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filesystem on /dev/xvde1 is now 20971520 blocks long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything goes well you should now see a much larger disk available
(a 80GB volume in my case):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:root&amp;#64;ip-aa-bb-cc-dd"&gt;root&amp;#64;ip-aa-bb-cc-dd&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;~]# df -h&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filesystem &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Size &amp;nbsp;Used Avail Use% Mounted on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/dev/xvde1 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 79G &amp;nbsp;1.7G &amp;nbsp; 77G &amp;nbsp; 3% /&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;none &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;3.7G &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 0 &amp;nbsp;3.7G &amp;nbsp; 0% /dev/shm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following posts were helpful to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=309754%F1%8B%A7%BA"&gt;https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=309754&amp;amp;#309754&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS&lt;/strong&gt;: After writing this I wonder if I’m expected to run resize2fs
after editing the root partition during the wizard process and starting
the instance… will try that next time.&lt;/p&gt;

unfortunate event. About 10 weeks ago my wife and I learned that she was
pregnant, something that we both wanted very much since our last child
was born in 2007. So for the last 10 weeks we have been taking all the
necessary steps to prepare our daughters, our house and our work
schedules to welcome another child into our family. We also decided that
we would break the news very slowly at first, making sure to share the
news with immediate family and close friends and planning to tell
everyone else after we had our first ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That first ultrasound happened this last Friday, and for the first time
we also had the kids with us in the room so they would be the first ones
to hear their baby sister/brother’s heart beat… but we didn’t. After 5
minutes of&amp;nbsp;unsuccessful&amp;nbsp;attempts to grab the slightest sound or sign of
a heart beat or even the faintest sign of movement, our doctor
recommended that we try the ultrasound at the local hospital, as they
had a more advanced machine and would be able to give us a more concrete
diagnostic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we spent Saturday and Sunday agonizing over what would happen Monday
morning when we were scheduled for the next session… and tried our best
to have as much of a normal life one can have, trying to shield our
children from the anxiety and 1000 horrible thoughts that kept creeping
through our heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we managed to get someone to watch over our kids and headed
early to UNC Hospital for what we expected would be a life changing
moment. I guess I could write about how we, my wife and I, agonized
every single second until we were finally taken into the ultrasound
room. How we held our breath waiting as the person operating the machine
performed some routine checks and measurements, before she finally
switched to the test we cared the most… and how heart breaking (how
ironic) it was to hear only the silence coming off the heart monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say we are very much heart broken and still trying to digest
what just happened to us. I believe I am coping a bit better than my
wife, but this feeling that I have things under control comes and goes
in waves. She keeps going over and over what she could possibly have
done differently, or what she may have done to endanger the life of our
unborn child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late afternoon yesterday I broke the news to our oldest daughter, and
after the initial shock she seems to have taken the news as well as a
child is expected to take. She has been very supportive and is always
telling her mom how much she loves her. However, I haven’t told our
youngest one yet… She’s been looking forward to sharing her room with a
new sibling and I don’t feel that we’re ready to tell her yet… but that
day will most likely be some time this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my wife had what the doctor called a “missed miscarriage”, the
10-week-old baby is still inside her and we now have to decide how to
proceed with the removal and disposal of what once was a living human
being. Tough decision to make, I assure you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our immediate family has been aware of the situation and has been
extremely supportive, even though they’re spread across NY and NJ. Our
pain is still very much fresh and we’re still debating what the next
step will be. With Halloween literally around the corner, we will also
have to make sure our kids are not affected by that next step, whatever
it may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to share a bit of our most intimate news with you all who
follow me and my friends who near or far are very important to us…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some quick back and forth with the Heroku guys I finally got it
fixed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
$ &amp;nbsp;rvm uninstall 1.9.3
$ &amp;nbsp;rvm reset
$ &amp;nbsp;sudo yum reinstall openssl openssl-devel
$ &amp;nbsp;rvm install 1.9.3
$ &amp;nbsp;rvm use 1.9.3 —default
$ &amp;nbsp;heroku login&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps someone else :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pylyglot.org"&gt;Pylyglot&lt;/a&gt;, my translation searching tool
that I use whenever I translate open source applications. Have not heard
about Pylyglot? Read the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pylyglot.org/about"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page
for more info!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for the long hiatus are too many to enumerate, but suffice
to say that the project is very much alive and I intend to keep updating
the translations database as often as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what’s new? For starters, there’s a new and fancy language selector
that let’s you also search for a language as you type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Language selector" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/102224/selector.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also support for pagination as searching for certain terms could
return quite a bit of results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pagination" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/102224/pagination.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the translations are only a couple of weeks old and should be
updated again soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I removed was the ability to ask &lt;strong&gt;Google Translate&lt;/strong&gt; to
provide the translation for a term. It is very unfortunately for I was
also working on a feature that would let you upload a translation file
(e.g. nautilus.po) and get back a fully translated file, where all
strings that were changed automatically were flagged as “fuzzy” by
default so that someone could then review the end result. But alas, due
to the somewhat recent changes to Google Translate policy, I decided
that it was not worth supporting this feature anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work and my personal life has kept me busy but I still intend to
maintain this project alive and hopefully turn it into something useful
for those who work on translations. There are a few things that I’d like
to do, such as update the code to be more &lt;strong&gt;Django 1.4&lt;/strong&gt; “compliant” and
turn the process of updating translations more dynamic and “on demand”.
Unfortunately hosting Pylyglot on a shared &lt;strong&gt;Dreamhost&lt;/strong&gt; environment and
using a “shotgun” approach doesn’t work well as they have some very
restrictive memory consumption threshold for individual processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, feel free to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/omaciel/pylyglot"&gt;fork&lt;/a&gt; the
code and send your suggestions (or pull requests). :)&lt;/p&gt;

wasn’t work related… so here’s a list, in no particular order, of what I
have been doing these days for those who were wondering what had
happened to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been asked to &lt;strong&gt;step into a new role at work&lt;/strong&gt;, and for the last
2-3 months I have been acting as the &lt;strong&gt;team lead&lt;/strong&gt; (no job title change
yet). As such, my day to day routine has changed dramatically, and I now
spend most of my time planning, organizing and building up our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of building our team involves spending some time getting to know my
&lt;strong&gt;teammates who are spread across 3 different countries and timezones&lt;/strong&gt;.
We have been using &lt;strong&gt;Google Hangout&lt;/strong&gt; for our weekly status meetings and
the ability to not only hear but see one another has definitely changed
for the better how we interact with each other. Every and single one of
my teammates are awesome and bring something unique and special to the
team!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;strong&gt;started working full time from home&lt;/strong&gt; and no longer have to do
the 50 miles/day commute to the office. I’ve had the opportunity to work
remotely before (twice a week) and I’m very comfortable with the idea.
As a matter of fact, I feel that I work harder and longer hours when I’m
home, as there are no cues to tell me to take breaks or that I have to
go home. Since &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.redhat.com/"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt; seems to have been
designed with a distributed/spread work force, there are quite a lot of
people who work remotely and all interaction is done via irc/email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project is actually a community driven, open project:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://katello.org/"&gt;Katello&lt;/a&gt;. Being able to tell people what I work
on and show them the source code is something I find priceless! For the
first time in my life I work for a company where “upstream” belongs to
the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also started learning both &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://clojure.org/"&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs"&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; for work. Having spent the
last 5-6 years as a “&lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt; guy” and &lt;strong&gt;Vim&lt;/strong&gt; user, this has been
by far the most radical change I’ve had to do so far. After going as far
as creating an alias that will start &lt;strong&gt;emacs -nw&lt;/strong&gt; whenever I type vim
in a console, I am starting to really enjoy the emacs + clojure
experience. I still press ESC a lot (old habits are hard to change)
though :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Been reading a lot! When I’m not reading a book, I’m catching up with
articles and news from several different sources. I use a combination of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.zite.com/"&gt;Zite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://flipboard.com/"&gt;Flipboard&lt;/a&gt;
and a few digital magazines (&lt;strong&gt;`Wired &amp;lt;http://wired.com/&amp;gt;`__&lt;/strong&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.smithsonian.com/"&gt;Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://theweek.com/"&gt;The
Week&lt;/a&gt;) for my daily news dose and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.instapaper.com/"&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; for those articles I want to
read at a later time. My &lt;strong&gt;iPad&lt;/strong&gt; has become a constant&amp;nbsp;and
reliable&amp;nbsp;companion. Some of the books I’ve read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also listen to a lot of music now that I can crank music really loud
without annoying a co-worker, so
&lt;strong&gt;`Pandora &amp;lt;http://www.pandora.com&amp;gt;`__&lt;/strong&gt;,
&lt;strong&gt;`Grooveshark &amp;lt;http://grooveshark.com/#!/ogmaciel&amp;gt;`__&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;`Radio
Paradise &amp;lt;http://www.radioparadise.com/&amp;gt;`__&lt;/strong&gt; have been a constant
presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I switched distros&lt;/strong&gt;!!! There, I said it! After &lt;strong&gt;6 years&lt;/strong&gt; running
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://foresightlinux.org"&gt;Foresight Linux&lt;/a&gt; exclusively, I have now
been running &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://fedoraproject.org/"&gt;Fedora 17&lt;/a&gt; on all of my
systems. The choice was completely work related and had nothing to do
with the current state of Foresight, its community or future (which I
can say is in very good hands by the way). Does that mean that my
involvement with Foresight will be affected? The answer, sadly, is yes.
My focus right now is fully concentrated on work and family and I don’t
think I will have the time or stamina to dedicate the amount of time
that running a GNU/Linux distribution requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to work and commitments to my family, my involvement with my pet
projects, translations and the &lt;strong&gt;GNOME Membership Committee&lt;/strong&gt; has
reached a stagnant point. Don’t be surprised if I “retire” from some of
my activities and start watching from the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of projects, I am still running my &lt;strong&gt;Brazilian
Portuguese&lt;/strong&gt;-only &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://castalio.info"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, publishing a new
episode every other week (&lt;strong&gt;40 episodes&lt;/strong&gt; and counting)! This is
something I’m totally committed to and even with my busy schedule I
still find time to enjoy doing the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also contemplating &lt;strong&gt;writing one or two books&lt;/strong&gt; in collaboration
with a good friend, but more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is it for now! 2012 has proven to be a very busy yet
fulfilling year for my entire family so far and several new and exciting
changes are coming down the pipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://clojure.org/"&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt; at work and didn’t like the idea of
using &lt;strong&gt;Eclipse&lt;/strong&gt; for my day to day work… so I started looking at how to
make &lt;strong&gt;vim&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;clojure&lt;/strong&gt; get along and came across a great
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://writequit.org/blog/?p=386"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;! Here are the distilled
notes plus minor tweaks to get anyone out there trying to do the same
thing going:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download &lt;strong&gt;VimClojure&lt;/strong&gt;
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2501"&gt;http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2501&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download &lt;strong&gt;VimSlime&lt;/strong&gt;
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime"&gt;https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract these files into your &lt;strong&gt;~/.vim&lt;/strong&gt; folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the following lines to &lt;strong&gt;~/.vimrc&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot; Settings for VimClojure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let vimclojure#HighlightBuiltins = 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let vimclojure#ParenRainbow = 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot; Send entire file to repl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nmap &amp;lt;C-m&amp;gt; ggVG&amp;lt;C-c&amp;gt;&amp;lt;C-c&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a repl session inside screen:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;screen -S clojure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lein repl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a clojure file with vim and highlight the method you want to
evaluate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press ctrl + c twice&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For session name prompt, enter ‘clojure’ which is the name of the
screen session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For window name prompt, accept the default number displayed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The selected code should be evaluated in the screen session&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I chose to start a repl using
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen"&gt;lein&lt;/a&gt; but you can use
whatever you’re familar with to get a repl started&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have lein inside a directory in my &lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt; as well as all of my
vim files and plugins. I then created soft links to them in my $HOME
directory which makes this whole thing very easy to access from
different systems as long as Dropbox is installed :)&lt;/li&gt;

we got to see a lot of the exhibits and still managed to find time to
eat at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lillyspizza.com/"&gt;Lilly’s&lt;/a&gt;. Did you know that the
entrance is &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; and the museum is sponsored by the &lt;strong&gt;State of North
Carolina&lt;/strong&gt; for our viewing and learning pleasure? Take that &lt;strong&gt;NYC&lt;/strong&gt; and

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2y9r6Wdw31r7yex1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Reitz&lt;/strong&gt;'s recent
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kennethreitz.com/repository-structure-and-python.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;
and spurred by recent events, I decided to turn an old python code I
wrote a while back into something that can be (hopefully) easier to get
to than by sheer luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m talking about
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://omaciel.github.com/choppedpress/"&gt;ChoppedPress&lt;/a&gt;, my script
that let’s you split &lt;strong&gt;WordPress&lt;/strong&gt; exported &lt;strong&gt;XML files&lt;/strong&gt; into smaller
files that can be easily imported into new WordPress installations. I’m
sure that some of you have experienced the frustration of not being able
to import this xml file due to size upload constraints on your host
providers… One of my close friends who provides mostly support for
WordPress gave me the idea a while back and that is how the script came
about. Little did I know that
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://snarfed.org/pyblosxom2wxr"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.ivandemarino.me/2010/10/12/From-Wordpress-to-Bloggart"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt;
have find it useful too, specially for migrating &lt;strong&gt;*away*&lt;/strong&gt; from
WordPress! As a matter of fact, I too used it when I moved to
&lt;strong&gt;Tumblr&lt;/strong&gt;, but that another story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this afternoon I took some time during my lunch break to create a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/omaciel/choppedpress"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; and put
together some very basic structure to give &lt;strong&gt;ChoppedPress&lt;/strong&gt; a proper
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://omaciel.github.com/choppedpress/"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; (yay &lt;strong&gt;GitHub
Pages&lt;/strong&gt;!!!). For the first time I also uploaded something I created to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/choppedpress/0.0.1"&gt;PyPi&lt;/a&gt;… Sure, this
may not be a big deal to some of you out there, but I can hardly contain
my excitement. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’m still enjoying a nice buzz from the experience. Obviously,
I look forward to comments, suggestions and/or improvements to the code,
but more than anything, I hope this will be useful to you too!&lt;/p&gt;

online viewers means I won't be reading their &lt;strong&gt;Books section&lt;/strong&gt; anymore.
It sort of became a good habit for me and something I look forward to on
Sunday mornings: as I drink my coffee and enjoy some peace and quietness
as the kids are still asleep, I enjoy catching up with the latest books
and reviews. This weekend ritual usually ends with a trip down to the
public library with the whole family. Both of my kids are already
checking out more books and movies than my wife and I together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to this decision by the NY Times, I understand that a for
profit establishment wants to, well, make money, and there’s nothing
wrong with that for sure. But for this weekend, Books section only
reader the options don’t make a lot of sense: &lt;strong&gt;pay $6 for the Sunday
edition&lt;/strong&gt; so I can read a small subset of it is a bit expensive, and I
am not very sure how much it costs to get the online version.&lt;/p&gt;

Programmers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Og Maciel,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just to let you know that &lt;em&gt;Pragmatic Guide to Git (eBook)&lt;/em&gt;
has recently been updated. You own an electronic version of this
book, and so you’ll be able to download this latest version. We have
also sent it to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://Amazon.com/"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; for delivery to
your kindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes in This Release&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third printing: includes a few minor errata fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the update either by logging in to your &lt;strong&gt;Bookshelf Home
Page&lt;/strong&gt;, or (if you’re already logged in) by downloading it from
&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave and Andy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;` &amp;lt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pragmaticbookshelf.com/"&gt;http://pragmaticbookshelf.com/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;`__&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pragmaticbookshelf.com"&gt;http://pragmaticbookshelf.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome right? They not only have informed me of an updated version of a
book I bought from them, but have also automatically sent it to my
&lt;strong&gt;Kindle&lt;/strong&gt;! More over, I can download my ebook in &lt;strong&gt;PDF&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;mobi&lt;/strong&gt; or
&lt;strong&gt;epub&lt;/strong&gt; format, all without any senseless “protection mechanism”. It is
this type of attention and treatment that have won me over and whenever
I need to buy a technical book, I immediately check their store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also worth mentioning is their monthly, free publication &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pragprog.com/magazines"&gt;PragPub
magazine&lt;/a&gt;, also available in many
different electronic types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I don’t get any type of financial incentive for writing this up,
so don’t feel that I’m trying to push off some type of affiliation code
in order to make money. I happen to enjoy their service and attitude
toward their customers and, if you’re ever decide to buy anything from
them I hope your experience will be as enjoyable as mine.&lt;/p&gt;

greeted early in the morning with the following email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations for reaching 90 days of service with Red Hat!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard for me to believe that it has been 3 months already since I
started this new chapter in my career! My days have been filled with so
many new things that it may explain why it literally feels like it was
only yesterday that I left &lt;strong&gt;rPath&lt;/strong&gt; to join the &lt;strong&gt;CloudForms QE Team&lt;/strong&gt;
here at &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still going through the transition period of coming off a startup,
super fast paced environment to a (much, much) bigger company trying to
solve a similar challenge. There is not a single day that goes by that I
don’t meet someone new or learn yet a new trick about &lt;strong&gt;YUM&lt;/strong&gt; or
&lt;strong&gt;RPM&lt;/strong&gt;. Keeping track of names, faces, where they sit and what they do
has been a challenge on its own, but I believe I’m making some progress.
Being the global company that we are, it is not always obvious where the
person you spent the last few hours working on IRC is from…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the last 3 months I’ve been learning all I can absorb about all
the different projects that are being developed here! I feel that I have
learned a lot but there is still a lot to learn, which is awesome! When
I think about the massive talent pool that we have and the caliber and
enthusiasm of my co-workers, plus the magnitude of the challenges ahead
and the impact that our projects will have in the enterprise world, I
can’t help but feel that I am at the right place and at the right time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I top this off? Yes, I can! For the first time in my life I can
proudly say that everything that I work on is &lt;strong&gt;not only truly open
sourced&lt;/strong&gt; but have a &lt;strong&gt;thriving community of collaborators outside
work&lt;/strong&gt;! In other words, anyone from outside Red Hat can see the issues
I’ve worked on, what’s currently assigned to me and even download and
play with the source code of the project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So these first 90+ days have been a blur of excitement and learning for
me and I’m really excited about the upcoming months and all the good
stuff that is yet to come down the pipe! &lt;strong&gt;It is a great time to be a
Red Hatter!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recentemente eu comecei o processo de migrar&amp;nbsp;o meu blog para
o&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ogmaciel.tumblr.com"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, e ao importar os posts
antigos do &lt;strong&gt;WordPress&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;eu sem querer iniciei uma enxurrada onde certos
agregadores estão mostrando&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;posts de 2007&lt;/strong&gt;… Ontem eu também
causei um problema similar no &lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt; e &lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por favor aceite os meus mais sinceros pedidos de desculpas pelo

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ogmaciel.tumblr.com"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, and in the process of importing
my archives from &lt;strong&gt;WordPress&lt;/strong&gt; I seem to have caused some issues with
certain aggregators that are now &lt;strong&gt;picking up posts from 2007&lt;/strong&gt;…
Yesterday I also triggered a massive torrent on both &lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desde que eu comecei a fazer o meu programa de podcasts (para quem ainda
não conhece, chama-se &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/about/"&gt;Castálio&lt;/a&gt;)
que eu tenho pensado em escrever este post, mas por um motivo ou outro,
nunca chegou a passar da idéia. O lance é que quando o podcast começou,
eu ainda não tinha um formato concreto de como iria fazer as
entrevistas, e como o primeiro episódio foi uma &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/episodio-0-og-maciel/"&gt;entrevista comigo
mesmo&lt;/a&gt;, eu não tive
uma oportunidade de falar sobre o meu &lt;strong&gt;Top 5&lt;/strong&gt;, que é uma coisa que
hoje eu pergunto a todos os meus entrevistados já no finalzinho das
entrevistas. O Top 5 é uma das minhas partes favoritas, porque me deixa
conhecer sobre quais &lt;strong&gt;músicas, filmes, livros, histórias, artistas&lt;/strong&gt; e
&lt;strong&gt;pessoas&lt;/strong&gt; que influenciaram a vida das pessoas com quem estou
conversando! Então, acabou que eu nunca tive a oportunidade de falar
sobre as coisas que influenciaram a minha vida… e em vez de fazer um
novo episódio sobre mim mesmo (mas a possibilidade ainda existe, quem
sabe?), decidi compartilhar aqui com você, leitor do meu blog, seja pelo
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://planeta.ubuntu-br.org/"&gt;Planeta Ubuntu Brasil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://planeta.gnulinuxbrasil.org"&gt;Planeta
GNU/Linux Brasil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://planeta.br.gnome.org/"&gt;Planeta GNOME
Brasil&lt;/a&gt;, ou qualquer outra forma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antes de mais nada, eu não poderia falar sobre quais foram os livros ou
autores que mais me marcaram sem mencionar o nome das pessoas
responsáveis por este “vício” tão bom que eu tenho desde pequeno: a
leitura. Primeiramente, &lt;strong&gt;meus pais&lt;/strong&gt; foram mais que primordiais em
cultivar em mim este hábito! Quando eu era ainda criança, meus pais
sempre compravam livros, seja para um de nós (tenho 2 irmãs), ou seja
para eles mesmos, e eu sempre ficava maravilhado ao ver aqueles livros
todos enfileirados nas várias prateleiras que adornavam nossa casa. E
não era só de enfeite não! Se meus pais não estavam lendo livros,
estavam folheando revistas, catálogos, búla de remédios… e foi com eles
que tudo começou!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A segunda influência que eu tive ainda novinho foi minha professora da
terceira série lá em &lt;strong&gt;São Franciso, MG&lt;/strong&gt;, Dona &lt;strong&gt;Maria Teresa
Mendonça&lt;/strong&gt; (que era também mãe do meu amigo &lt;strong&gt;Rúbens Mendonça&lt;/strong&gt; “Pé de
Pato, Mão de Onça” :))! Foi na terceira série que ela criou o &lt;strong&gt;Clube do
Livro&lt;/strong&gt; e nos presenteou com um armário lotado de livros de todos os
gêneros! Foi neste ano que eu aprendi a apreciar ainda mais a leitura, e
foi devido à esta professora que eu nunca mais parei de ler!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Então vamos lá, aqui segue uma compilação meio que ainda tentativa dos
10 mais importantes livros ou autores que influenciaram a minha vida de

da &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Jos%C3%A9_Dupr%C3%A9"&gt;Maria José
Dupré&lt;/a&gt;:
Este foi o primeiro livro que eu lí sozinho, ou seja, não foram meus
pais que leram para mim. Por algum motivo que eu ainda não consigo
explicar, o cachorrinho Samba tomou controle completo da minha
imaginação, e depois dele eu simplesmente devorei todos os outros
livros da série do cachorrinho Samba e os outros da Maria José Dupré,
como &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.livrariasaraiva.com.br/produto/306678/a-mina-de-ouro-colecao-cachorrinho-samba/"&gt;A Mina de
Ouro&lt;/a&gt;

Não tem como eu falar sobre livros e minha infância sem falar sobre
esta coleção de livros! Não me lembro dos detalhes de como que os
livros foram publicados, se foi um novo a cada semana, etc, mas só
sei que entre minhas irmãs e eu, nós provavelmente lemos quase todos
os livros que apareceram na nossa frente! Mais uma vez, se não fosse
pela Dona Maria Teresa, eu não teria visto &lt;strong&gt;“A Ilha Perdida”, “A
Turma da Rua Quinze”, “Aventuras de Xisto”, “Coração de Onça”,
“Menino de Asas”, “O Escaravelho do Diabo”&lt;/strong&gt;, para mencionar alguns!
A &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Lista_de_volumes_da_cole%C3%A7%C3%A3o_Vaga-Lume"&gt;lista completa dos
livros&lt;/a&gt;
eu deixo aqui para quem estiver interessado.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monteiro_Lobato"&gt;Monteiro Lobato&lt;/a&gt;:
Provavelmente a maior influência entre todos os livros e autores que
eu já lí, os livros do &lt;strong&gt;Monteiro Lobato&lt;/strong&gt; foram os que eu mais lí,
re-lí, e viví na minha infância! Quem me conhece dos tempos onde eu
morava em &lt;strong&gt;São Franciso, MG&lt;/strong&gt;, sabem muito bem como que passei horas
&lt;strong&gt;tentando capturar o Sací&lt;/strong&gt; da mesma forma que o &lt;strong&gt;Pedrinho&lt;/strong&gt;
tentou, ou usava pó de perlim-pim-pim para me imaginar viajando para
paises e mundos distantes! Só sei que eu queria ser um escritor,
igual Monteiro Lobato quando crescer! ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BAlio_Verne"&gt;Júlio Verne&lt;/a&gt;:
Mais um autor que me fez companhia durante a infância! Não sei
exatamente quantos de seus livros eu lí no total, mas dentre eles o
que eu mais curtí foi um chamado “&lt;strong&gt;Dois Anos de Férias&lt;/strong&gt;”!
Infelizmente, quando eu me mudei do Brasil para os Estados Unidos em
1991, tive de vender ou doar todas as minhas coisas, e dentre elas,
minha coleção encadernada do Júlio Verne.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tio_Patinhas"&gt;Tio Patinhas&lt;/a&gt;: Tudo
bem que revistinha em quadrinho (ou você chama isso de gibí?) não é
livro, mas aqueles almanaques do Tio Patinhas que saiam de vez em
quando com histórias quilométricas com o &lt;strong&gt;Pato Donald&lt;/strong&gt; e seus
sobrinhos, se metendo em aventuras prá lá de malucas foram fonte de
muita inspiração quando pequeno!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_do_Escoteiro-Mirim_(Editora_Abril)"&gt;Manual do
Escoteiro-Mirim&lt;/a&gt;:
Ainda falando sobre revistinhas e tal, a Disney lançou o Manual do
Escoteiro-Mirim, e eu ia na casa do &lt;strong&gt;Márlon&lt;/strong&gt; (amigo da minha irmã
mais nova) quase todos os domingos só para sentar na cadeira de
balanço que tinha na varanda dele e passar horas lendo e tentando
aprender tudo o que eu podia sobre a arte de ser um escoteiro! Foi
por causa deste livro que eu acabei entrando nos “&lt;strong&gt;Lobinhos&lt;/strong&gt;” e
depois nos &lt;strong&gt;Escoteiros&lt;/strong&gt; lá em São Francisco, MG (“Patrulha do
Touro”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homero"&gt;Homero&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp; Lá na casa do
&lt;strong&gt;Márlon&lt;/strong&gt; também tinham livros que atraíram minha curiosidade, e
depois de ler sobre “&lt;strong&gt;Os 12 Trabalhos de Hércules&lt;/strong&gt;” com o
Monteiro Lobato, fiquei mais que apaixonado pelas aventuras descritas
no “&lt;strong&gt;A Odisséia&lt;/strong&gt;” e “&lt;strong&gt;A Ilíada&lt;/strong&gt;” de &lt;strong&gt;Homero&lt;/strong&gt;! Desde
então eu lí vários livros sobre mitologia grega, mas foi com Homero
que eu peguei o gostinho por este tópico!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naufrágio&lt;/strong&gt;: Da mesma forma que mitologia grega me atraia quando
pequeno, livros sobre naufrágios foi mais uma categoria que mecheu
muito com a minha imaginação. “&lt;strong&gt;A Ilha do Tesouro&lt;/strong&gt;” de &lt;strong&gt;Robert
Louis Stevenson&lt;/strong&gt; (que por sinal foi o primeiro livro que eu lí no
Clube do Livro na terceira série), “&lt;strong&gt;Os Robinsons Suiços&lt;/strong&gt;” de
&lt;strong&gt;Johan David Wyss&lt;/strong&gt;, “&lt;strong&gt;As Viagens de Gulliver&lt;/strong&gt;” de &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan
Swift&lt;/strong&gt;, “&lt;strong&gt;Robinson Crusoé&lt;/strong&gt;” de &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Dafoe&lt;/strong&gt;, e vários
livros do Júlio Verne foram alguns dos livros que eu lí muito (e me
fizeram secretamente desejar que eu també ficasse naufragado em uma
ílha deserta, onde eu pudesse usar todos aqueles truques que eu
aprendi no “Manual do Escoteiro-Mirim”)!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Os Meninos da Rua Paulo&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp; Este livro do &lt;strong&gt;Ferenc Molnár&lt;/strong&gt; foi
fonte de inspiração para a criação do meu primeiro clube, “&lt;strong&gt;Os
Brasinhas&lt;/strong&gt;”, e da minha primeira “guerra” contra o clube
adversário para capturar sua bandeira! Foi um dia de muita aventura,
adrenalina, pedrada e mamona verde nas costas, mas isso é assunto
para outro dia! “&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Os_Meninos_da_Rua_Paulo"&gt;Os Meninos da Rua
Paulo&lt;/a&gt;” é
um dos poucos livros da minha infância que eu adoraria ter comigo,
mas infelizmente ainda está falntando na minha coleção…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tex Willer, Ken Parker, Zagor&lt;/strong&gt;, e &lt;strong&gt;Asterix&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp; Fechando meu Top
10 não podia faltar estes personagens do mundo de aventuras dos
quadrinhos! Foi com o Tex, Ken, Zagor e Asterix e amigos que eu
aprendi bastante sobre cowboys, velho oeste, legião romana, e um
pouco da geografia dos Estados Unidos e Europa Ocidental! Já cheguei
a ter mais de 600 revistas destes personagens, mas infelizmente
também tive de me desfazer delas na “grande mudança” para os Estados
Unidos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ao compilar esta lista vários outros autores e livros também vieram à
tona, mas como o objetivo era manter tudo em uma lista com 10 entradas,
não coloquei &lt;strong&gt;Isaac Asimov&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Tolkien&lt;/strong&gt;, “&lt;strong&gt;Memórias de Um Cabo de
Vassoura&lt;/strong&gt;”, &lt;strong&gt;Mark Twain&lt;/strong&gt;, dentre outros. Até mesmo a série do
&lt;strong&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/strong&gt; já faz parte dos meus livros favoritos, mas eu acho que
os que eu listei neste post foram realmente os que mais me marcaram e,
de uma forma, moldaram a minha vida!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bem, é isso aí! Desejo a todos vocês um excelente final de ano, e um
maravilhoso 2012! Depois eu volto para contar o meu Top 10 de músicas e
filmes! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last October I celebrated a couple of milestones in my life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 years&lt;/strong&gt; living in &lt;strong&gt;North Carolina&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 years&lt;/strong&gt; since I bought my &lt;strong&gt;first house&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 years&lt;/strong&gt; married to &lt;strong&gt;my wife&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 years&lt;/strong&gt; working for &lt;strong&gt;rPath&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, each one of those milestones were very important to me
as they mark important decision points in my life! Every single one of
them changed my life for the better and I can’t help but feel blessed
that I have so many things to look forward to at end of the year that
remind me how lucky I have been!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week was my also an important day for me, as I was offered and
accepted a job to work at &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt; as a &lt;strong&gt;Senior QA Engineer&lt;/strong&gt; for
their &lt;strong&gt;CloudForms&lt;/strong&gt; team! I assure you that it was a bitter sweet
moment for me, for a really loved the work I had been doing at rPath.
But the chance to work on Red Hat’s cloud initiative was too much of a
temptation for me to pass! I have been truly blessed for having had the
chance to join rPath 5 years ago at a point where they were still trying
to establish themselves among the big technology providers out there.
Five years later they’ve accomplished their goal and I can look back and
feel proud that all the late nights, cancelled vacations and hard work
paid off!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This December I get to work on a very exciting project with a great
bunch of guys trying to accomplish a similar task! I am extremely
excited about the potential that CloudForms and its derivatives will
bring to the masses and I can only hope to be able to look back five
years from now and be able to celebrate another job well done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To infinity, and beyond!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olá pessoal! Foi com um enorme pezar que eu recebi a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sejalivre.org/?p=5698"&gt;notícia&lt;/a&gt; sobre o falecimento de &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://andregondim.eti.br/"&gt;André
Gondim&lt;/a&gt;, uma figura do software livre
Brasileiro que, infelizmente, nos deixou na semana passada… O meu
relacionamento com o André começou em 2005 quando eu ainda administrava
a equipe de traduções do &lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu Brasil&lt;/strong&gt;. Assim como o &lt;strong&gt;Fábio
Nogueira&lt;/strong&gt; e &lt;strong&gt;André Noel&lt;/strong&gt;, pessoas que eventualmente também ocuparam o
cardo de coordenador desta equipe, o André Gondim foi uma das pessoas
com quem eu tive o prazer de trabalhar e instruir no processo de
traduções. Durante o nosso dia-a-dia, vi o trabalho e dedicação que ele
sempre trazia e pude acompanhar o seu desenvolvimento e crescimento
dentro da equipe. Mesmo depois que eu parei de contribuir com o Ubuntu e
parti para traduções para o &lt;strong&gt;GNOME&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Xfce&lt;/strong&gt; e &lt;strong&gt;LXDE&lt;/strong&gt;, com a ajuda
do André foi possível sincronizar o trabalho entre as equipes e assim
garantir que o Ubuntu tivesse uma tradução de qualidade e ao mesmo tempo
respeitar o trabalho dos tradutores das equipes GNOME, etc, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://andregondim.eti.br/"&gt;http://andregondim.eti.br/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/andregondim?ref=ts"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/andregondim?ref=ts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O André foi um usuário ativo em várias comunidades e sempre presente no
canal &lt;strong&gt;#tradutores&lt;/strong&gt; da rede freenode onde muitos dos tradutores
brasileiros de software livre se encontram para trocar idéias, sugestões
e bater papo…. Na sexta-feira, dia 4 de novembro, seu usário ainda
estava presente no canal… O André será sempre lembrado no canal dos
tradutores, assim como o &lt;strong&gt;Rafael Higino&lt;/strong&gt;, como uma pessoa que estava
sempre disposta a ajudar quem quer que fosse, sempre com entusiasmo,
cordialidade e boa vontade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screenshot.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Usuário do André no canal dos tradutores" src="http://www.castalio.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screenshot-300x124.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apesar de ter conversado com ele muitas vezes nos últimos anos, eu
infelizmente não tive a oportunidade de conhecê-lo pessoalmente. Durante
o evento &lt;strong&gt;FISL&lt;/strong&gt; desde ano ele tinha me convidado para ficar em sua
casa, já que eu estava programado para participar do evento, mas devido
à mudanças na minha vida pessoal, tive de cancelar a minha ida ao
Brasil. Mas tenho certeza que um dia ei de encontrá-lo e poderemos então
finalmente nos conhecer e colocar o papo em dia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anuncio aqui então que tanto o &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://planeta.gnulinuxbrasil.org/"&gt;Planeta GNU/Linux
Brasil&lt;/a&gt; quanto o&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/"&gt;Castálio
Podcast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;estão de luto até o final do
ano&lt;/strong&gt;! Também foi publicado um &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/episodio-especial-andre-gondim-ubuntu-brasil/"&gt;episódio
especial&lt;/a&gt;
no podcast, como minha homenagem ao &lt;strong&gt;André Gondim, um símbolo de força
de vontade, coragem e um super tradutor brasileiro&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatos:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Membro do &lt;strong&gt;Launchpad&lt;/strong&gt; desde &lt;strong&gt;setembro 12, 2005&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu Member&lt;/strong&gt; desde &lt;strong&gt;fevereiro 03, 2008&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8,250&lt;/strong&gt; contribuições de tradução para o Ubuntu pelo &lt;strong&gt;Rosetta&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;66&lt;/strong&gt; contribuições de tradução para o &lt;strong&gt;GNOME&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who follow my many different projects and enterprises, you
probably already know that I have been hosting a podcast called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/"&gt;Castálio Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, a bi-weekly show where
I interview people from the &lt;strong&gt;Brazilian FOSS&lt;/strong&gt; world and talk about
their likes, dislikes and what events and factors shaped their lives!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked my listeners if they would be interested in an episode in
English with someone new and exciting, the answer was an overwhelming
‘&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for my very first episode in English I chose to interview a good
friend of mine from several years:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Pete Savage&lt;/strong&gt;! During the next 58
minutes we talked about how we first met through a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;PyGtk&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;video he
posted a while back during a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Linux User Group&lt;/strong&gt;meeting, how he
first got involved with&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Edubuntu&lt;/strong&gt;, and then moved on to several
other projects such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ProgBox&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;GeekDeck&lt;/strong&gt;, about the books
that he’s written including the reason for writing “&lt;strong&gt;Emblem
Divide&lt;/strong&gt;”, how much the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Japanese culture&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;plays a role in his
daily life, and his&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Top 5&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;movies, books and movies! While the
episodes’ in English future are yet to be determined, this latest
episode can be downloaded

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Raw Filesystem images, here’s how I currently use it &amp;nbsp;with
&lt;strong&gt;QEMU&lt;/strong&gt;. In my &lt;strong&gt;.bashrc&lt;/strong&gt; file I have an alias that will boot them and
redirect it’s internal ports &lt;strong&gt;80&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;22&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;apache&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ssh&lt;/strong&gt;)
to my system’s port &lt;strong&gt;8080&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;2222&lt;/strong&gt; respectively. I also forward
port &lt;strong&gt;3389&lt;/strong&gt; for Windows systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sudo &lt;span class="pre"&gt;qemu-kvm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; 2048 &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-hda&lt;/span&gt; &amp;quot;$1&amp;quot; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-boot&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-soundhw&lt;/span&gt; ac97 &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-redir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;tcp:8080::80&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-redir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;tcp:2222::22&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-redir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;tcp:9999::3389&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I call my alias and pass a raw filesystem image as an argument,
I can then use &lt;strong&gt;localhost&lt;/strong&gt; as the destination to my http and ssh
connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a special configuration in my &lt;strong&gt;.ssh/config&lt;/strong&gt; file to make
it easier for me to ssh to these virtual systems and not have to change
my &lt;strong&gt;known_hosts&lt;/strong&gt; file every time I boot a different system and try to
ssh to localhost on port 2222:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home"&gt;2011 Open Source
Awards&lt;/a&gt; was launched
on the 1st week of August by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.packtpub.com/"&gt;Packt&lt;/a&gt;,
inviting people to submit nominations for their &lt;strong&gt;favorite Open Source
project&lt;/strong&gt;. Now in its sixth year, the Awards continue in its aim of
encouraging, supporting, recognizing and rewarding all Open Source
projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;2010 Open Source Award Winners&lt;/strong&gt; included the Open Source
&lt;strong&gt;Content Management System (CMS)&lt;/strong&gt; Award winner &lt;strong&gt;CMS Made Simple&lt;/strong&gt;,
Open Source &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript Libraries&lt;/strong&gt; Award winner &lt;strong&gt;jQuery&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;Pimcore&lt;/strong&gt; the winner of the &lt;strong&gt;Most Promising Open Source Project
Award&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2011 Awards will feature a &lt;strong&gt;prize fund of $24,000&lt;/strong&gt; with several
new categories introduced and the vote of the public becoming more
influential. This year all CMS projects will compete in an even tighter
contest in the Open Source CMS Award category with the now defunct Hall
of Fame CMS finalists re-entered into the CMS category. Projects such as
&lt;strong&gt;Drupal&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Joomla&lt;/strong&gt;! will face off with &lt;strong&gt;CMS Made Simple&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;MODx&lt;/strong&gt; for the first time since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Most Promising Open Source Project and the Open Source
JavaScript Libraries categories will be back for a second year, Packt is
introducing &lt;strong&gt;new categories&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;Open Source Business
Applications&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Open Source Multimedia Software&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Open Source
Mobile Toolkit and Libraries&lt;/strong&gt;. These new categories will ensure that
the Open Source Awards remain committed to providing the platform to
recognise excellence within the community while supporting Open Source
projects both new and old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We’ve managed to continue to provide new levels of accessibility for
Open Source projects, while encouraging a more competitive nature in the
contest by increasing the public votes influence. Additionally, we
thought it would be a great idea to reward more projects thus we’ve
introduced sub-category awards across a number of the categories during
the voting stage. We expect the Awards this year to be bigger and
better.”&lt;/em&gt; said &lt;strong&gt;Julian Copes&lt;/strong&gt;, organizer of this year’s Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packt has opened up nominations for people to submit their favorite Open
Source projects for each category at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.PacktPub.com/open-source-awards-home"&gt;www.PacktPub.com/open-source-awards-home&lt;/a&gt;
. The top five in each category will go through to the final, which
begins mid-September. For more information on the categories, read
Packt’s recent announcement:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.packtpub.com/blog/2011-open-source-awards-announcement"&gt;www.packtpub.com/blog/2011-open-source-awards-announcement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having bought books from them before, I’m very happy to support their
initiative and invite the readers to not only participate of this event
but check out their books and EBooks as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Openbox 3.5.0&lt;/strong&gt; was
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://openbox.org/wiki/Openbox:Changelog"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, and
with it several bugs got fixed and a few new features were added. Out of
these features the one that I liked most was the ability to add &lt;strong&gt;icons
to menus&lt;/strong&gt; (and submenus as well)! Yeah, I know some other managers
already do this but for someone who enjoys running Openbox because of
its simplicity and keyboard binding limitless possibilities, I was sure
glad to see some eye candy make its way to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you want to try it, make sure that your distribution has the new
Openbox compiled with Imlib2. Next, add the following line to the
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;menu&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; section of your &lt;strong&gt;*rc.xml*&lt;/strong&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;lt;showIcons&amp;gt;yes&amp;lt;/showIcons&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, modify your &lt;strong&gt;*menu.xml*&lt;/strong&gt; by adding an icon attribute to what
ever menu item or menu you want to add an icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
&amp;lt;menu id=&amp;quot;apps-net-menu&amp;quot; icon=&amp;quot;/usr/share/icons/Tango/24x24/apps/internet-web-browser.png&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;menu id=&amp;quot;apps-net-menu&amp;quot; label=&amp;quot;Internet&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;menu id=&amp;quot;apps-net-browsers&amp;quot; label=&amp;quot;Browsers&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;item label=&amp;quot;Firefox&amp;quot; icon=&amp;quot;/usr/share/icons/hicolor/24x24/apps/firefox.png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;action name=&amp;quot;Execute&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;firefox&amp;lt;/command&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;startupnotify&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;enabled&amp;gt;yes&amp;lt;/enabled&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;wmclass&amp;gt;Firefox&amp;lt;/wmclass&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/startupnotify&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/action&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/item&amp;gt;
        .
        .
        .
&amp;lt;/menu&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to restart openbox and enjoy your fancy new menu!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Openbox 3.5.0&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;foi
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://openbox.org/wiki/Openbox:Changelog"&gt;lançado&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;ontem, e com ele
vários problemas (bugs) foram resolvidos e alguns novos recursos foram
adicionados. Dentre estes novos recursos, o que eu gostei mais foi poder
adicionar &lt;strong&gt;ícones aos menus&lt;/strong&gt; (e submenus também)! Tá, eu sei que
outros gerenciadores fazem isso, mas para alguém que como eu curto o
Openbox por sua simplicidade e possibilidades ilimitadas de atalhos de
teclado, eu fiquei super empolgado de ver um pouco de “eye candy” ser
adicionado ao projeto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Então, se você estiver interessado em experimentar isso, certifique-se
que sua distribuição já atualizou o Openbox e que ele foi compilado
com&lt;strong&gt;Imlib2&lt;/strong&gt;. Aí, adicione a seguinte linha na seção&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;menu&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; do
seu arquivo&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;*rc.xml*&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;lt;showIcons&amp;gt;yes&amp;lt;/showIcons&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depois é modificar o seu arquivo &lt;strong&gt;*menu.xml*&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;à gosto, adicionando um
atributo &lt;strong&gt;icon&lt;/strong&gt; no ítem de menu ou menu desejado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
&amp;lt;menu id=&amp;quot;apps-net-menu&amp;quot; icon=&amp;quot;/usr/share/icons/Tango/24x24/apps/internet-web-browser.png&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;menu id=&amp;quot;apps-net-menu&amp;quot; label=&amp;quot;Internet&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;menu id=&amp;quot;apps-net-browsers&amp;quot; label=&amp;quot;Browsers&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;item label=&amp;quot;Firefox&amp;quot; icon=&amp;quot;/usr/share/icons/hicolor/24x24/apps/firefox.png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;action name=&amp;quot;Execute&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;firefox&amp;lt;/command&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;startupnotify&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;enabled&amp;gt;yes&amp;lt;/enabled&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;wmclass&amp;gt;Firefox&amp;lt;/wmclass&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/startupnotify&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/action&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/item&amp;gt;
        .
        .
        .
&amp;lt;/menu&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lembre-se de re-iniciar o openbox e curta o seu novo menu!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another episode of my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://castalio.info"&gt;Castálio Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, this
time with &lt;strong&gt;Aline Duarte Bessa&lt;/strong&gt;, another Brazilian who is participating

&lt;p&gt;After debating for the last couple of months about re-organizing my two
blogs into a more intuitive (perhaps logical even?) format, I finally
took advantage of some down time over the weekend and made a few
changes. From now on, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ogmaciel.com"&gt;www.ogmaciel.com&lt;/a&gt;
will no longer be my blog written in &lt;strong&gt;English&lt;/strong&gt;, but instead will serve
as a “business card/window” into my world. My “English” blog is now
hosted on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.ogmaciel.com"&gt;en.ogmaciel.com&lt;/a&gt; and my
“&lt;strong&gt;Brazilian Portuguese&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; blog lives on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.ogmaciel.com"&gt;pt.ogmaciel.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to maintain one of the blog aggregators (aka “planets”) I
kindly ask you to update my feed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.ogmaciel.com"&gt;Journal of an Open Source&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;English&lt;/strong&gt;):
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/JournalOfAnOpenSourcee"&gt;http://feeds.feedburner.com/JournalOfAnOpenSourcee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.ogmaciel.com"&gt;Open Source Guy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Brazilian
Portuguese&lt;/strong&gt;):&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/OpenSourceGuyPosts"&gt;http://feeds.feedburner.com/OpenSourceGuyPosts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing I did over the weekend was to change my email signature
to no longer include “&lt;strong&gt;GNOME Board of Directors&lt;/strong&gt;”. Sometimes I
catch myself remembering that wasn’t too ago that I dreamed of joining
the Board and making a difference… I feel that I learned a lot about the
&lt;strong&gt;GNOME&lt;/strong&gt; project as a whole, as well as about a lot of the people
behind it. I didn’t fulfill all of the things I wanted to accomplish
(work, real life and a bit of inexperience got on the way of things some
times) but I sure hope that people will appreciate the things I did get
done. In the end I chose not to run for re-election because the time is
just not right for me, but I don’t rule out running again in the near
future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, &lt;strong&gt;update your feeds&lt;/strong&gt; and best of luck to the new &lt;strong&gt;GNOME Board
of Directors&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depois de debater por alguns meses sobre re-organizar os meus dois blogs
de uma forma mais intuitiva (quem sabe até mesmo mais lógica?),
finalmente aproveitei uma trégua que tive no fim de semana para fazer
algumas modificações. De hoje em diante, o site
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ogmaciel.com"&gt;www.ogmaciel.com&lt;/a&gt; não vai ser mais o meu
blog em &lt;strong&gt;inglês&lt;/strong&gt;, mas servirá de “cartão de visitas/vitrine” do meu
mundo. Meu blog em inglês agora será hospedado em
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.ogmaciel.com"&gt;en.ogmaciel.com&lt;/a&gt; e meu blog em &lt;strong&gt;português
do Brasil&lt;/strong&gt; ficará em &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.ogmaciel.com"&gt;pt.ogmaciel.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Se você for o mantenedor de um agragador de blogs (ou “planetas”), eu
peço por gentileza que atualizem o meu feed apropriadamente:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uma outra coisa que eu fiz foi remover a linha na minha assinatura de
e-mail que dizia “&lt;strong&gt;GNOME Board of Directors&lt;/strong&gt;”. Às vezes me pego
lembrando que não faz muito tempo que eu sonhava em ser parte da mesa
diretora do projeto &lt;strong&gt;GNOME&lt;/strong&gt; e fazer uma diferença… Eu sinto que eu
aprendi muito sobre como o projeto funciona, assim como muitas das
pessoas que também trabalham nele. Eu sei que não consegui completar
todos os objetivos e metas que eu tinha prometido fazer (meu trabalho,
vida pessoal e falta de experiência atrapalharam um pouco), mas eu
espero que as coisas que eu sim consegui fazer sejam apreciadas por
todos. No final eu decidi não me candidatar novamente por que sinto que
o tempo não é propício para mim, mas isso não quer dizer que eu não
venha a me candidatar num futuro próximo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bem, então para finalizar, &lt;strong&gt;atualizem o meu feed&lt;/strong&gt; e boa sorte para os
novos membros do novo &lt;strong&gt;GNOME Board of Directors&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a chance to interview &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://igorsoares.com/"&gt;Igor Pires
Soares&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;Fedora Project&lt;/strong&gt; and chat
about how he got started with translations, participating on several
organizing committees and his travels around the world! He talks about
&lt;strong&gt;getting lost in Chile&lt;/strong&gt;, learning English and Spanish, the role his
university played on his career, his top 5 books, movies and his
interest in music, including a very special moment during a &lt;strong&gt;U2 show in
São Paulo&lt;/strong&gt;. The interview is in Brazilian Portuguese, but anyone who
can speak Portuguese or Spanish should be able to enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Howdy fellow GNOMErs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to invite you all to join us once again for another &lt;strong&gt;GNOME
Foundation IRC Meeting&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;When&lt;/strong&gt;: Wednesday, June 15th, from 14:00 to 15:00 UTC (&lt;a class="reference external" href="//timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=15&amp;amp;month=6&amp;amp;year=2011&amp;amp;hour=14&amp;amp;min=0&amp;amp;sec=0&amp;amp;p1=0"&gt;your local
time&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;strong&gt;Where&lt;/strong&gt;: irc.gnome.org, #foundation&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foundation IRC meetings are just that, meetings held on&amp;nbsp;#foundation&amp;nbsp;in
irc.gimp.org&amp;nbsp;to discuss current matters related to the GNOME&amp;nbsp;Foundation.
Any GNOME Foundation member or non member are welcome. As long as
you&amp;nbsp;contribute positively to the discussion you are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting is moderated by Board members that are present, and they
will&amp;nbsp;guide the discussion through all the Agenda topics. Everyone
can&amp;nbsp;comment and speak at any time, just remember to be respectful and
concise so it’s easy for everyone to follow the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tthis is a great opportunity to discuss the topics you care about, or to
get more information from the Board if you think we’re not communicating
enough on some topics ;-) The agenda of the meeting is really up to you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please add the agenda items you’d like to discuss
to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://live.gnome.org/FoundationBoard/MembersAgenda"&gt;http://live.gnome.org/FoundationBoard/MembersAgenda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depois de ter gravado mais de &lt;strong&gt;9 episódios&lt;/strong&gt; do &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/"&gt;Castálio
Podcast&lt;/a&gt; (se você ainda não escutou, não
sabe o que está acontecendo), e conversar sobre os acontecimentos,
&lt;strong&gt;músicas&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;livros&lt;/strong&gt; e &lt;strong&gt;filmes&lt;/strong&gt; que moldaram a vida dos meus
convidados, comecei a meditar sobre alguns dos livros que eu curtia ler
quando garoto. Quando eu ainda morava no Brasil, nós tínhamos uma
biblioteca bem variada na minha casa, com livro para tudo quanto é
gosto… mas quando me mudei para os &lt;strong&gt;Estados Unidos em 1991&lt;/strong&gt; (para ler
um pouco mais sobre esta história, leia a minha coluna na &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.revista.espiritolivre.org/?p=961"&gt;edição
25&lt;/a&gt; da revista
&lt;strong&gt;Espírito Livre&lt;/strong&gt;) eu tive de deixar tudo para trás para trazer somente
o que cabia na mala (até parece aquela música do &lt;strong&gt;Engenheiros do
Hawaii&lt;/strong&gt;). Foram caixas e caixas de livros que eu tive de doar e eu
tenho certeza que nunca mais vou poder recuperar todos eles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estes dias me lembrei de uma série de livros que eu gostava muito de
ler, e hoje, meio que em um ato de desespero, venho perguntar se alguém
teria como me mandar qualquer livro desta série. Trata-se dos livros da
&lt;strong&gt;Irani de Castro&lt;/strong&gt; (que na verdade era um pseudônimo do escritor &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/pt/wiki/H%C3%A9lio_do_Soveral"&gt;Hélio
do
Soveral&lt;/a&gt;)
com os personagens da&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Sociedade Secreta dos Seis (SS6)&lt;/strong&gt;, ou &lt;strong&gt;Os
Seis&lt;/strong&gt; como eram conhecidos. Baseado no Wikipedia, foram mais de 19
livros com as aventuras desta turma que me mantiveram super motivados a
ser um detetive “quando eu fosse grande”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pesquisando no &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://duckduckgo.com/"&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt; descobri pelo
menos dois lugares
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lista.mercadolivre.com.br/irani%20de%20castro"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.livrosdificeis.com.br/index.php?meio=biblioteca_eletronica&amp;amp;TxtBusca=os+seis&amp;amp;CmdEnviar.x=0&amp;amp;CmdEnviar.y=0"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;)
onde vendem alguns livros usados, mas n’ao parece que eles enviam para
os Estados Unidos… E então? Será que tem alguém por aí que tem algum
livro desta coleção que não se importaria em mandar para mim pelo
correio? :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow marks the &lt;strong&gt;20th&lt;/strong&gt; year that I have been living in the United
States. Not to use an old cliché, but it definitely feels like it wasn’t
too long ago that I embarked on the greatest and most dramatic adventure
of my life: at the young age of 16 (only a handful of weeks shy of my
17th birthday) I said goodbye to most of my friends back in the small
town of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=Concei%C3%A7%C3%A3o+da+Barra,+Brazil&amp;amp;sll=35.930614,-79.030687&amp;amp;sspn=0.013691,0.015428&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Concei%C3%A7%C3%A3o+da+Barra+-+Esp%C3%ADrito+Santo,+Brazil&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=10"&gt;Conceição da Barra,
Brazil&lt;/a&gt;
and got on a plane with my youngest sister bound to &lt;strong&gt;New York City&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to understand the impact of this event on my life, allow me to
take a step back and explain what it was like for someone who had never
traveled outside of his own country to find himself “dropped” in the
middle of a place like the Northeast of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conceição da Barra&lt;/strong&gt; was the place in Brazil where I spent my teenager
years and experienced all that comes with them. It was the place where I
fell in love and also where I had my heart broken for the first
time&amp;nbsp;(and many times after that and after that). It was the place where
I learned to socialize, go out dancing, drinking, getting in trouble and
really understand what it means to be alive and have friends! It’s where
I learned to enjoy watching the sunsets and the warmth of a bonfire by
the beach, listening to &lt;strong&gt;Led Zeppelin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Dire Straits&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Pink
Floyd&lt;/strong&gt; and enjoying good company. It is also the place where I saw my
family’s economical situation deteriorate and got a very good look at
what poverty feels like. But if I were to summarize what the last 5
years I spent in that tiny beach town encroached in the Southeast of
Brazil meant to me in a simple sentence, it would be: It’s the place
where I had the most amazing childhood!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that my previous description gave you a good glimpse at what my
life had been until then, allow me now to bring you to the day before I
got on that plane. Even though I knew the day of my departure, nothing
can prepare you to say goodbye to those who shaped your life, specially
those whom we call best friends or those who have gotten a “strong hold
on your heart”! How can you say goodbye to the friend who spent most of
his days with you, going through the same experiences, happy moments,
aches and all? How can you tell the girl you’re in love with that you’re
leaving and has absolutely no idea (if) when you’ll ever return? The
answer is, you just can’t prepare yourself and have to do the best that
you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I spent my last day in Brazil looking for friends and family and
telling them that I was leaving to the United States where my parents
already were awaiting for me. Since I had not told anyone about this
plan, imagine the look on their faces when I dropped the news! Some
people cried and hugged me really hard… some didn’t believe me and
thought I was joking… others, who heard the news (in a small town like
Conceição da Barra, news travel really, really fast) from others before
I could get to them, chose not to see me for they couldn’t face the fact
that we would not see each other again. Out of those who fit this last
criteria, the ones I wished I had had a chance to talk to before leaving
were Alexandre, my friend and brother-in-arms, and Andréia, my
platonic&amp;nbsp;infatuation/love. To this day I’m yet to see them and tell them
how much it hurt me not being able to talk to them that last day…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I made my way to the United States, landing on &lt;strong&gt;JFK&lt;/strong&gt; in a
sunny May 28th morning together with my younger sister. Our parents
picked us up at the airport, and after the initial feelings of relief
and happiness for seeing them (I had not seen them for about 1 month and
was pretty much in charge of my younger sister), the next few weeks were
all a blur of new sights, sounds, places and people. Since neither one
of us spoke a word of English, this experience was the equivalent of
taking someone from the smallest, most rural and disconnected town in
the world and then dropping him by parachute in the middle of
&lt;strong&gt;Moscow&lt;/strong&gt;! Everything, and I mean &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt; was different from
what I was used to. Chewing gum, shampoo, cars, streets, food, trees,
birds, sports, you name it! Also, everywhere I turned there was this new
language being spoken, broadcast on the radio, television or printed on
magazines and newspapers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahhh and how much I missed my friends… There wasn’t a day that I didn’t
think of them, or what they were doing at that exact time. As a mater of
fact, for a long time I lived my life split between my old stomping
grounds and my newly adopted country, almost never here but always
there, imagining what it would be like to share my experiences in this
new “alien” world with them… tell them how cool baseball really was when
you knew all the rules and got to follow the &lt;strong&gt;Yankees&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;MSG&lt;/strong&gt;
every day… how beautiful the &lt;strong&gt;Empire States building&lt;/strong&gt; is from the
&lt;strong&gt;Palisades Avenue&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Cliffside Park&lt;/strong&gt;… how people would toss
perfectly working and even new items in their garbage outside because
they had gotten a newer model/replacement… and how much my life sucked
without being able to talk to people and make new friends…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By September my parents enrolled me in the local high school as a
junior. My first day’s experience was an event that left pretty deep
scars that took a while to completely heal. I had no idea what my
schedule was, that I was supposed to change classes between periods, and
that people could be so mean when they found out that you didn’t speak
English. Worse of all for that day was being ostracized by the few
Brazilians I encountered also attending the same high school. I clearly
remember on that first day during my lunch period walking into a packed
cafeteria and the relief I felt when I saw the 2 girls who were
Brazilian (I was told by my guidance council) among all the other
strangers… and the frustration and disappointment I felt when they told
me I could not sit down with them. Turns out they were also trying to
fit in and didn’t want people hearing them talking to another kid in a
language other than English. For the next 4 months I ate lunch by myself
in a table all the way by the corner of the cafeteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember one Saturday morning being awoken by my guidance council on
the phone asking me why I wasn’t at school to take my &lt;strong&gt;SATs&lt;/strong&gt; (SA
what???)? So I showed up, not really knowing what I was supposed to do
or why I had to take a test in math and English. With my 2+ months of
do-or-die English knowledge but my far superior knowledge in math and
without any type of preparation, I managed to score a &lt;strong&gt;1040&lt;/strong&gt; on my
SATs (640 in Math, 400 in English out of 1600 possible points all
together). Throughout the years I also managed to join the &lt;strong&gt;High School
Honors Society&lt;/strong&gt;… &lt;strong&gt;twice!&lt;/strong&gt;And had an &lt;strong&gt;A average&lt;/strong&gt; in all of my
classes during those 2 years of high school. As a matter of fact, due to
my A average on all subjects, I was exempt from taking my finals as a
senior! Not bad for someone who got dropped into a new culture 2 years
before, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with all of these&amp;nbsp;achievements I was still viewed by my peers as a
foreigner and someone who did not belong.&amp;nbsp;Every now and then a teacher
or even a guidance council would remark on how someone like us,
foreigners, were so good at learning things so fast despite of our
background. Back then and even today those remarks still sound like they
were amazed at ‘how someone so inferior to them in all aspects could
pick up “tricks” so fast’. I’m pretty sure that some of those remarks
were responsible for a good number of kids dropping out before
completing high school or even from going to college or a higher
education.&amp;nbsp;Eventually I graduated from high school and went on to earn a
B.S. in &lt;strong&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/strong&gt; and many more new adventures. But these will
have to wait for another post, I’m afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I look back at all of these experiences I can’t help but feel glad!
Now that I am older and &lt;strong&gt;father of 2 beautiful girls&lt;/strong&gt;, I can totally
appreciate my childhood and what happened during those years. It is
because of these experiences that I learned to appreciate the decisions
and sacrifices that my parents made and appreciate the things I’ve
achieved along the way. Here’s to the adventures that are sure to come
for the next 20 years!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a day off tomorrow to fly to NYC with my oldest daughter so we
can both attend this year’s &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bookexpoamerica.com/"&gt;Book Expo
America&lt;/a&gt; (BEA) at the &lt;strong&gt;Javits
Center&lt;/strong&gt;. We’re both very excited about this chance of seeing so many
books and the possibility of meeting some of the authors, such as &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mowillemsdoodles.blogspot.com/"&gt;Mo
Willems&lt;/a&gt;! Unfortunately I’m
going to miss meeting &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.jamesdashner.com/"&gt;James Dashner&lt;/a&gt;
as he’s scheduled to give out sample chapters of his upcoming book only
on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will also be the first time I travel anywhere with only one of my
kids, so I’m definitely looking forward to spending some quality time
with her and take a lot of pictures. For someone like us who enjoy
reading and think that the &lt;strong&gt;public library&lt;/strong&gt; or Barnes &amp;amp; Noble are the
best place on earth to hang out, going to BEA should be something she
will never forget!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I pimped my &lt;strong&gt;Django Dev Kit Appliance&lt;/strong&gt;, mostly
because I have been really busy with work, projects and my kid’s end of
the school year. Anyhow, I rebuilt the appliance to use the latest
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2011/mar/23/13/"&gt;Django 1.3
release&lt;/a&gt; plus
several other updated packages such as git and mercurial. I have also
&lt;strong&gt;stopped building Amazon EC2&lt;/strong&gt; images and will from now on only provide
&lt;strong&gt;ISO&lt;/strong&gt;s and &lt;strong&gt;Raw Filesystem&lt;/strong&gt; images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Raw Filesystem images, here’s how I currently use it &amp;nbsp;with
&lt;strong&gt;QEMU&lt;/strong&gt;. In my .bashrc file I have an alias that will boot them and
redirect it’s internal ports &lt;strong&gt;80&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;22&lt;/strong&gt; (apache and ssh) to my
system’s port &lt;strong&gt;8080&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;2222&lt;/strong&gt; respectively. I also forward port
&lt;strong&gt;3389&lt;/strong&gt; for Windows systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sudo &lt;span class="pre"&gt;qemu-kvm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; 2048 &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-hda&lt;/span&gt; &amp;quot;$1&amp;quot; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-boot&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-soundhw&lt;/span&gt; ac97 &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-redir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;tcp:8080::80&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-redir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;tcp:2222::22&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-redir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;tcp:9999::3389&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I call my alias and pass a raw filesystem image as an argument,
I can then use localhost as the destination to my http and ssh
connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a special configuration in my .ssh/config file to make it
easier for me to ssh to these virtual systems and not have to change my
known_hosts file every time I boot a different system and try to ssh to
localhost on port 2222:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Host qemu User root Port 2222 Hostname localhost StrictHostKeyChecking no UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t believe it’s been this long already, but it is time for yet
another &lt;strong&gt;Board of Directors Election&lt;/strong&gt;! Having had the opportunity to

&lt;p&gt;With all the blog posts, newsfeeds and social media channels abuzz with
the latest and greatest releases these past 2 days I just wanted to take
the time to add one more thank you note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank You&lt;/strong&gt; all &lt;strong&gt;developers&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;translators&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;document writers&lt;/strong&gt;,
&lt;strong&gt;graphic designers&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;bug trackers&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;release engineers&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;everyone else&lt;/strong&gt; involved in working directly with the &lt;strong&gt;upstream
projects&lt;/strong&gt; and for making all of the moving pieces that compose a Linux
distribution readily available for anyone to use! There are just too
many to mention, but if you spent the last few months working your butt
off on an upstream project, &lt;strong&gt;I salute you&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;Patriotism can flourish only where racism and nationalism are given
no quarter. We should never mistake patriotism for nationalism. A
patriot is one who loves his homeland. A nationalist is one who
scorns the homelands of others.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Johannes_Rau"&gt;Johannes

graphical interface for managing their systems packages and/or updates,
mainly because the development for the &lt;strong&gt;conary backend&lt;/strong&gt; fell out of
scope and our radar (this is a nicer way to say that we didn’t have
someone to maintain it). But thanks to the work of &lt;strong&gt;zodman&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;jesse&lt;/strong&gt;
and others &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.packagekit.org/"&gt;PackageKit&lt;/a&gt; is making its way
back to our desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=”attachment_1395” align=”aligncenter” width=”296”

&lt;p&gt;There’s still some work to be done but I believe that most blockers and
kinks have been ironed out, as I have been able to use it to install
packages and update my system in the last couple of days. Once we deem
it stable for generic use, you will all get it the next time you
manually (hopefully, for the last time)&amp;nbsp;run: sudo conary updateall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=”attachment_1396” align=”aligncenter” width=”300”

&lt;p&gt;If you got copious free time or are just curious about the conary
backend, clone the &lt;strong&gt;PackageKit&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gitorious.org/packagekit"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; and check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, congratulations to everyone involved in the release of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnome.org/news/2011/04/gnome-3-0-has-arrived/"&gt;GNOME
3.0&lt;/a&gt;! In
the past, my contributions were mostly related to translating
applications to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://l10n.gnome.org/languages/pt_BR/"&gt;Brazilian
Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;, but my role on
that front was very minimal this time and consisted of a handful of
translations and several commits of the awesome work done by others.
Most of my contributions for 3.0 are related to the work I do for the
&lt;strong&gt;GNOME Foundation Board of Directors&lt;/strong&gt;, but I won’t bore you to tears!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, a huge congrats to the &lt;strong&gt;Banshee&lt;/strong&gt; crew with their
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gburt.blogspot.com/2011/04/banshee-20-is-here.html"&gt;2.0&lt;/a&gt;
release! I wonder what is the next platform they’re going to take on now
that both Windows and Mac are already supported. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to inform anyone who’s currently running &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.foresightlinux.org"&gt;Foresight
Linux&lt;/a&gt; what to expect as far as when
&lt;strong&gt;GNOME 3.0&lt;/strong&gt; will be available via an update. Basically, in order to
bring this new release to our Foresight users, the following tasks (in
ascending degree of complexity and potential risk to stability and
usability) must be tackled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update &lt;strong&gt;Glib&lt;/strong&gt; and create a separate &lt;strong&gt;Gtk3&lt;/strong&gt; package that can
co-exist with &lt;strong&gt;Gtk2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update all packages that have a dependency on
&lt;strong&gt;gobject-introspection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update packages to use new &lt;strong&gt;Gtk3&lt;/strong&gt; package, considering that some
packages may have duo-binding to &lt;strong&gt;Gtk2&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Gtk3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-build &lt;strong&gt;all GNOME packages&lt;/strong&gt; as well as anything that has a
dependency on &lt;strong&gt;Gtk2/Gtk3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest concern right now is breaking our existing &lt;strong&gt;KDE&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;Xfce&lt;/strong&gt; packages, so will do our best to throughly test the update and
migration processes &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; making GNOME 3.0 available. In the
meantime, other packages will be updated and made available to you
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gburt.blogspot.com/2011/04/banshee-20-is-here.html"&gt;Banshee
2.0&lt;/a&gt; is
already available!) &amp;nbsp;via the usual command: &lt;strong&gt;*sudo conary updateall*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work has also started to bring &lt;strong&gt;PackageKit&lt;/strong&gt; back to &lt;strong&gt;Foresight&lt;/strong&gt; to
provide a graphical interface for all your package management needs. The
future promises!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have downloaded and installed the latest &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.foresightlinux.org/release/announcing-foresight-linux-2-5-0/"&gt;Foresight Linux
2.5
release&lt;/a&gt;,
here are a couple of things you may want to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Your System&lt;/strong&gt;: Since Foresight has a rolling release
schedule, we already have updates for you, including and newer
&lt;strong&gt;MPlayer&lt;/strong&gt; with support for &lt;strong&gt;Blue-Ray&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;em&gt;sudo conary updateall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install Chromium web browser&lt;/strong&gt;: Try this pretty cool web browser
made by &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;. Got a &lt;strong&gt;gMail&lt;/strong&gt; account? Take advantage of the
bookmarks and password synchronization feature and have it all
seamlessly integrated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;em&gt;sudo conary update chromium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install Hotot&lt;/strong&gt; and keep up with your friends on &lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;em&gt;sudo conary update hotot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rock out with Spotify&lt;/strong&gt; and enjoy a great music service!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;em&gt;sudo conary update spotify&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terminator&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the very first things I install on my
systems and if you rely on using a solid and feature-filled terminal
like I do, you will definitely install it too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;em&gt;sudo conary update terminator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Speaking of &lt;strong&gt;must haves&lt;/strong&gt; my list would be incomplete with out
installing &lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt;! I keep all of my “dot” files such as vimrc
and bashrc in a directory hosted by Dropbox and then symlink them in
my systems so that whenever I make any change to one of them, the
change is propagated instantaneously to my other systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;em&gt;sudo conary update nautilus-dropbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, feel free to drop by &lt;strong&gt;#foresight&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;freenode&lt;/strong&gt; and let
us know what you think of Foresight and how we can improve your
experience! &lt;strong&gt;Your Distro Should Be Cool!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

hear: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wp.me/pEMZT-bN"&gt;Foresight Linux 2.5.0&lt;/a&gt; is out and
about! This is our first official release in almost 2 years
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://distrowatch.com/5480"&gt;2.1.1&lt;/a&gt; was released May 15th, 2009!!!)
and it is filled to the brim with the very latest stable applications

schedule&lt;/strong&gt; and bring all the coolest new applications to your desktop!
Expect to hear a lot from us from now on… &lt;strong&gt;Because your distro should

caption=”Feel Good”]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ogmaciel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/3891444873_a5d09e1c59_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Feel Good" src="http://www.ogmaciel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/3891444873_a5d09e1c59_m.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more of a “feel good” post, mostly for me! Through my life I
have come across a fork on the road many times, and for the last 4+
years I have always chosen the path to the &lt;strong&gt;right&lt;/strong&gt;. Even when the left
side sometimes looked a bit more “paved” and less difficult to walk
through, I still chose the &lt;strong&gt;right path&lt;/strong&gt;! The reasons are many, but I
think I can distill them into one single sentence: I believe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m talking about the technology that we develop here at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rpath.com"&gt;rPath&lt;/a&gt; and apparently, I’m not the only one to
feel this way either! It makes me extremely proud to know that something
I work on is perceived as a game changer to a bunch of people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The challenge that most IT organizations have today when it comes
to the complexity of enterprise IT is an inability to visualize the
relationships between all the moving parts that make up a specific
IT service. While there has been some resistance to IT automation
historically, it’s pretty clear that enterprise IT will not scale in
this age of virtualization and cloud computing without it.&amp;quot;- &lt;strong&gt;Mike
Vizard&lt;/strong&gt;, CTO &lt;strong&gt;Edge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The future of IT lies in storing system knowledge in an automated
system and putting it to use when a new system is about to be
unleashed.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;- &lt;strong&gt;Charlie Babcock&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;InformationWeek&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There are two main strengths to [rPath X6]: The DevOps articulation
is the major strength—configuring and releasing a new application or
changes to an application is a process fraught with human errors.
The complexity is such that issues are inevitable. These issues have
a ripple effect on service quality and agility. The other major
strength is the IT service supply chain that will play a major role
in the future. IT will have a choice of delivery platforms that they
did not have before [physical server, virtual server, public or
private cloud]. Applications will need to be easily &amp;quot;movable&amp;quot; to any
platform. This is where rPath has a big role to play.&amp;quot; - &lt;strong&gt;JP
Garbani&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Forrester&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Pity the poor admin whose job it is to keep track of all the
versions of operating systems, applications and firmware and the
interdepencies between them all, so as not to hit a conflict when
installing or deinstalling something that brings everything grinding
to a halt. In a cloud environment, when everything is virtualized it
gets even harder to manage as resources are constantly being moved
around.&amp;quot; - &lt;strong&gt;Jo Maitland&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;SearchCloudComputing.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;rPath is an integral part of our strategy, providing a powerful
solution for automating and standardizing how we turn applications
into deployable systems and how we maintain and re-use them over
time. For most companies this is a manual, cumbersome process, but
rPath makes it simple and automated. We’re very excited about this
next-generation version of rPath, in particular the dynamic and
visual user experience and rich configuration management
capabilities it introduces.&amp;quot; - &lt;strong&gt;Ed Seymour&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Fujitsu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Enterprise IT is undergoing a radical transformation fueled by
scale and change, contracting budgets, and the growing need for
speed, Because of massive system complexity and the need for rapid
deployment and change, IT needs a new and better approach. They
cannot achieve this quality without embracing an automated
application release solution to ensure efficient, repeatable,
accurate and reliable application deployments.&amp;quot; - &lt;strong&gt;Ronni
Colville&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Gartner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, are you feverishly working on the &lt;strong&gt;translation&lt;/strong&gt; for the upcoming
&lt;strong&gt;GNOME 3.0&lt;/strong&gt; release? Do you find yourself often wondering how a
certain word was translated across the entire desktop applications?
Well, I do and this is why I developed
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pylyglot.org"&gt;Pylyglot&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;Django&lt;/strong&gt;-driven localization
tool that let’s you search for a word and see how it has been translated
for a given language. The plan is to have fresh data straight from the
GNOME &lt;strong&gt;git&lt;/strong&gt; repositories every Monday for now, eventually switching to
a more frequent update schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I’m getting a 500 error when you click on the list of packages
for a certain word, but I hope I can fix it over this weekend. There is
an &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/omaciel/pylyglot/issues/23"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; filed for
it, and if you have the time and interest in helping me fix it or
suggestions (and patches) to improve the overall experience, please
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/omaciel/pylyglot"&gt;fork&lt;/a&gt; the project and come chat
with me on &lt;strong&gt;#pylyglot&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;freenode:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was around the end of 2006. Having spent most of my life living in
the New Jersey - New York axis and close to my family, I bought a
one-way ticket to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rdu.com/"&gt;RDU&lt;/a&gt;, packed my bag (yeah,
&lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; bag) and came down to &lt;strong&gt;North Carolina&lt;/strong&gt; looking for a new job.
Leaving my wife (who was expecting our second child) and young daughter
while I went “job spelunking” wasn’t easy for me, but I was determined
to quit the rat race once and for all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first couple of days were spent hanging out at &lt;strong&gt;Weaver Street
Market&lt;/strong&gt; and the coffee joint at the &lt;strong&gt;UNC&lt;/strong&gt; book store, reading all the
local newspapers and trying to network with the locals as much as I
could. By the end of the second day I was invited for an interview at a
&lt;strong&gt;Duke&lt;/strong&gt; research department, but other than that, there wasn’t much
going on yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the fifth day depression and frustration set in. I also missed my
wife and kid a lot… My sister, who back then was finishing her Masters
and lived in &lt;strong&gt;Chapel Hill&lt;/strong&gt;, convinced me to attend a poetry reading
session early in the morning. I figured that I needed to clear my mind a
bit and poetry was probably a good way to do that. But I also knew that
I couldn’t let myself be depressed for too long, so I convinced her to
accompany me to my very first &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.trilug.org/"&gt;TRILUG&lt;/a&gt; for a
bit more of networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right around noon I received an email for another job interview… but in
&lt;strong&gt;New Jersey&lt;/strong&gt;! Now, it’s true that I wanted to make North Carolina my
new home, but when your money reserve starts to dwindle before your
eyes, beggars can’t be too choosy. As the interview was scheduled for
the following Monday, I bought a plane ticket back to New Jersey for
Friday evening so that I could spend another day looking for a job
before returning home for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to drag my sister to attend that Thursday’s TRILUG meeting
proved to be one of those lucky strikes that life throws at you every
now and then. I don’t remember what the main topic that night was, but I
remember meeting &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://drowninginbugs.blogspot.com/"&gt;Daniel Chen&lt;/a&gt;
and the conversation that, little did I know, would turn my life
completely upside down. It was Daniel who said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since you want to work with &lt;strong&gt;Open Source&lt;/strong&gt; and Python, you should
send your cv to the guys at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rpath.com"&gt;rPath&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… and so I did…that same night… at around 11pm… The very next day I got
up at 8am and there was a reply in my INBOX from &lt;strong&gt;Ken Vandine&lt;/strong&gt; from
rPath, asking about my availability for a phone interview that same day.
We settled for a phone call at 9am which, turns out, would lead to an
invitation for an interview at their office in Raleigh… &lt;strong&gt;Monday
morning&lt;/strong&gt;! As I couldn’t cancel my plane ticket without paying a steep
fine AND not feeling totally comfortable with cancelling the interview
in Jersey that same Monday, we decided to schedule it for Tuesday at
8am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flew back home with renewed energy and even though my bank statement
showed a scarily low balance, I bought another ticket back to RDU for
the last flight out of NY Monday evening, right after my interview. The
interview itself went really well, but deep in my heart I was looking
forward to chatting with the rPath folks. One interesting thing that
came out of the Monday interview was that for the very first time in my
life I felt the power that having a blog in a highly visible news
aggregator can do for you: at the end of the interview I was told that
some of the engineers knew of me from my blog and my advocacy for Ubuntu
(yeah… I was young and inexperienced)… and wanted to meet me! So I was
“paraded” in their engineering area like a rock star, shaking hands and
exchanging information. A very interesting experience for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my interview I drove straight to &lt;strong&gt;LGA&lt;/strong&gt; (or was it &lt;strong&gt;JFK&lt;/strong&gt;? Can’t
remember…) and waited forever for my flight that got delayed several
hours due to a storm system that had settled over RDU. By the time I
arrived back in North Carolina, it was almost 1am Tuesday and I was
hungry, tired and with a pounding headache. Around 4am I finally fell
asleep only to be awaken by the alarm clock at 6:30am. Shaving, shower
and a quick breakfast was followed by a (always) tranquil commute to
Raleigh, where rPath’s HQ is located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview process was a grueling, 3-4 hour long marathon, where I
was interviewed by several different individuals (I remember &lt;strong&gt;jtate&lt;/strong&gt;,
&lt;strong&gt;yeliaB&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;bpja&lt;/strong&gt;… maybe &lt;strong&gt;msw&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;smerp&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;dugan&lt;/strong&gt;?)
asking me varying questions of equally varying levels of difficulty.
When I was done, I felt exhausted and almost missed my exit on my way
back to my sister’s modest 1-bedroom apartment. I had barely plugged my
laptop and gotten on IRC when I received a message from &lt;strong&gt;kenvandine&lt;/strong&gt;
inviting me to meet &lt;strong&gt;Erik Troan&lt;/strong&gt;, one of rPath’s founders, the
following morning. I immediately accepted it, knowing really well that
it would be the final and decisive interview, one “for all the marbles”
as they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My meeting with Eric was all but what you’d expect from a “last stage,
meeting the CEO” interview. At 8am sharp, in walks Eric wearing Bermuda
shorts, a t-shirt, flip-flops, sipping on a apple juice box (like those
we give to kids) to greet me and escort me into his office. For the next
35 minutes, Eric comfortably settled on his chair with both of his feet
resting atop the desk, we talked about beer, coffee, travelling and
Europe… in other words, everything but the job itself. And just like
that, he got up, shook my hand, thanked me for coming in and walked me
out of the office. I was dumbstruck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not knowing what had just happened, I called my wife in Jersey and I
remember telling her: “Have I got the job? I have absolutely no idea
what just happened, but if he is planning to open a bar of coffee place
in Europe, I may have a shot!” This easy going and relaxed atmosphere
would be a constant reminder for me for the years to come that companies
should make sure that their employees feel welcome and comfortable at
work if they want productivity and loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got back to my laptop at the UNC coffee place, I had a job offer
from the place in Jersey (they would send me another email 1 hour later
cancelling their offer, citing a technical glitch from their part that
made the previous email get sent erroneously) and &lt;strong&gt;an offer from
rPath&lt;/strong&gt; via IRC!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On October 2nd, 2006&lt;/strong&gt; I walked into my current job at rPath and what
has proven to be a life changing experience. As someone I know recently
said, an awesome roller coaster ride with more twists, turns and air
time than I could ever have dreamed of! Early on, for the most part, it
felt like drinking from a fire hose as I struggled to switch to a fast
paced startup environment and using an enormous variety of different
technologies and tools from those I had grown used to at my previous
employers. Through the many ups and downs that we’ve gone through, one
constant has remained with me at all times: my unfaltering, unshakable
commitment to the company, to its goals and my love for
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Conary_(package_manager)"&gt;conary&lt;/a&gt;,
their next generation software package management system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culmination of this love/passion is the birth of my personal pet
project, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.conaryrecipes.com/"&gt;Conary Recipes&lt;/a&gt;, a web site
compendium of conary “recipes” for those who, like me, understand and
appreciate the beauty and power that a conary-managed system can offer
to power users, and want to learn by example how to leverage it to
package software for their own use. It is also a place where seasoned
packagers can show off their skills and let other people vote for their
favorite recipes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.conaryrecipes.com/"&gt;Conary Recipes&lt;/a&gt; is the fruit of my
adventures into the wonderful world of &lt;strong&gt;Django&lt;/strong&gt; and is brought to you
thanks to the hard work of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://elyezer.com/"&gt;Elyézer Mendes
Rezende&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.quartoestudio.com/web/"&gt;Evandro
Pastor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.pawelpogorzelski.pl/"&gt;Pawel
Pogorzelski&lt;/a&gt;, who willingly jumped
at my invitation to work on my new project and selflessly devoted their
free time to help me get it off the ground! As we’re still working out
the kinks and workflow for the web site, access is by &lt;strong&gt;invitation
only&lt;/strong&gt; until we feel that we’re ready for public usage. If you’re truly
interested in taking the site for a spin and helping us improve the

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git In The Trenches&lt;/strong&gt;, or GITT is a pretty cool project by my friend
&lt;strong&gt;Peter Savage&lt;/strong&gt;, “&lt;em&gt;designed to be a book that focusses on teaching
people to use Git by associating with scenarios that are experienced by
a fictional company called Tamagoyaki Inc. Through reading about their
day to day lives, the reader will learn not only how to use Git, but why
version control systems are important and how to implement them within
an organisation.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a chance to see the first 3 chapters yesterday over lunch and I
really enjoyed the way the book is coming together. He was kind enough
to send me a PDF but you can follow the progress of his book (and maybe
even file a “bug”) on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cbx33/gitt"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;. If
you’ve tried to learn how to use &lt;strong&gt;Git&lt;/strong&gt; before and got put off by
technical books, you may want to check out &lt;strong&gt;Git In The Trenches&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably remember &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1303"&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt;
about my issues with running my &lt;strong&gt;WordPress&lt;/strong&gt;-based blog on
&lt;strong&gt;Dreamhost&lt;/strong&gt;'s environment, and how frustrated I was with the
experience of using their &lt;strong&gt;Private Server&lt;/strong&gt; services. The short version
is that I eventually migrated my blog back to their shared hosting
environment, turned off&amp;nbsp;most of the plugins and cried myself to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very next day, after reading (and replying to) the comments I
received, one in particular caught my eye: &lt;strong&gt;Amazon’s Free Usage Tier&lt;/strong&gt;
offering new customers the following &lt;strong&gt;EC2&lt;/strong&gt; services each month for one
year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;750 hours of EC2 running Linux/Unix Micro instance usage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;750 hours of &lt;strong&gt;Elastic Load Balancing&lt;/strong&gt; plus 15&amp;nbsp;GB data processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10&amp;nbsp;GB of &lt;strong&gt;Amazon Elastic Block Storage&lt;/strong&gt; (EBS) plus 1 million IOs,
1&amp;nbsp;GB snapshot storage, 10,000 snapshot Get Requests and 1,000
snapshot Put Requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15&amp;nbsp;GB of bandwidth in and 15&amp;nbsp;GB of bandwidth out aggregated across
all AWS service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds really good, doesn’t it? I took a good look around and saw a
couple of interesting
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.agileweboperations.com/migrate-your-wordpress-blog-to-a-bitnami-ec2-instance"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.jayway.com/2009/05/07/blogging-among-the-clouds/"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;
from people who took advantage of this offer to move their blogs “to the
clouds”, and being the adventurous guys that I am, I signed up for a new
account and proceeded to take the steps to move this blog to my own EC2
instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing was to create a back up/dump of my blog’s database and
WordPress files. I then started looking for a good Linux appliance with
all the necessary applications (i.e. &lt;strong&gt;Apache, MySQL, PHP&lt;/strong&gt;, etc) as I
didn’t feel like starting with a plain “bare bones” system and
installing individual packages. I looked for a &lt;strong&gt;CentOS&lt;/strong&gt;-based
appliance but as I couldn’t really tell how good some of the ones that
came up in my search were, I ended up choosing the WordPress stack from
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bitnami.org/"&gt;Bitnami&lt;/a&gt;. This proved to be the path of least
resistance in the end as several people seem to have used it to do the
same exact thing I wanted to do (and the fact that it has an active
community also means I can have some level of support).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend the instructions from this
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.agileweboperations.com/migrate-your-wordpress-blog-to-a-bitnami-ec2-instance"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;
for the process of taking your database dump and using it to populate
your new database (make sure to either create a new user that matches
your existing configuration OR modify your wp-config.py to use the
default user from the instance), and configuring the Apache web server.
Do make sure to read everything, specially the sections related to a
couple of issues that came up for the author, so that you can hopefully
sidestep them. Also, as the appliance already comes with WordPress
installed in &amp;nbsp;/opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/, you may want to
selectively choose what files to copy from your backup into this
directory, such as themes, plugins, uploads, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, setting up my current domain to redirect to my EC2 instance was
extremely easy to do, using Dreamhost’s DNS services (you can use this
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://manual.squarespace.com/domain-setup/domain-mapping-with-dreamhost.html"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;
up to step 6, skipping step 5)&amp;nbsp;in conjunction with Amazon’s Elastic IPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today marks the 7th day I switched this blog to my EC2 instance and so
far I have had absolutely no issues or regrets! I feel very confident
that I can expand its capabilities and not worry about bogging it down.
Load average has been around 0.15 and I also have plenty of free RAM to
go around. Once my one year promotion expires, bar any unexpected
surprises, I feel pretty confident that I may continue to use it as a
paid user.&lt;/p&gt;

license. The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nerdson.com/blog/criativos-comuns/"&gt;original
strip&lt;/a&gt; was written in
Brazilian Portuguese but someone took the time to do a quick translation
into English (as the translator is not a native Brazilian Portuguese
speaker, some things got lost in the translation, but the end result is
still worth checking). So here is the finished work, enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back I came across a reference to a book that really caught my
attention: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Lifecycle-Software-Objects-Ted-Chiang/dp/1596063173/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1297290928&amp;amp;sr=8-7"&gt;The Lifecycle of Software
Objects&lt;/a&gt;
by &lt;strong&gt;Ted Chiang&lt;/strong&gt;. At first glimpse, based on the title, I thought that
it would be a technical book related to &lt;strong&gt;object oriented programming&lt;/strong&gt;
and &lt;strong&gt;software life cycle&lt;/strong&gt;, but time would put me in for a good
surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time later someone gave me a copy of another Ted Chiang book, a
collection of short stories titled “&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Ted-Chiang/dp/1931520720/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1297351710&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Stories of Your Life: and
Others&lt;/a&gt;”.&amp;nbsp;?If
I could summarize my impressions with this book in one simple word, it
would be: &lt;strong&gt;Wow&lt;/strong&gt;! All of the short stories included were very
captivating and well written, something that, in my humble opinion, is
something very hard to pull off when compiling a list of short stories
from one single author. Ted Chiang shows over and over that he really
does his homework while researching for a story, so if you enjoy reading
a good story with a clear and solid technical background intermingled in
the plot, you’re in for a special treat! His prose and style just flows
so easily that anyone can pretty much follow the logic behind the varied
themes behind each story even if you’ve never read about object oriented
programming or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/wiki/Optics/Fermat's_Principle"&gt;Fermat’s
Principle&lt;/a&gt;
before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend this book to anyone who’s interested in reading
something new and fresh that will give you enough food for thought for
quite a while!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately about 1&amp;nbsp;1/2 years ago I had the opportunity to lay my
hands on “&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://emblemdivide.com/"&gt;Emblem Divide&lt;/a&gt;”, a book
written by my good friend Peter Savage. If I remember correctly, it had
been a long time since I had last read science fiction, so I viewed that
as a good opportunity to try something different. The plan was that I
would read it and provide some feedback in exchange for being able to
read his book first hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read the first 10 chapters &amp;nbsp;on my computer during lunch break (I was
given a PDF) and honestly, I had a hard time focusing on the story due
to the fact that I was very much used to reading in a quiet place and
the computer provided a constant source of distraction. I’d find myself
reading a paragraph and before I realized I’d be checking my RSS feeds
or replying to someone on IRC. After the 10th chapter I decided that I’d
give the book another try once I had a way to read it away from the
computer. Now that I have a &lt;strong&gt;Kindle&lt;/strong&gt;, I got a mobi format of the book
and started reading it from the start last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Emblem Divide&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; was written through the course of 6 years and
unfortunately you can see that the gaps between writings have made the
first chapters feel a bit disconnected. You can &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; how the author’s
writing style and prose change from chapter to chapter and there were a
few contradictions here and there, but eventually Peter gets on a nice
groove and starts telling us the story of &lt;strong&gt;Oken Brown&lt;/strong&gt;. In this not so
far future, the world has undergone a series of massive changes in its
political organization and society lives in a constant state of fear
ever since the Temporal War of 2028. It is also a world where Global
Temporal Enforcement Programme, or G-TEP,&amp;nbsp;keeps an eye on anyone who
wants to tamper with time travel and use it to change the outcome of the
future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a lot of reading and researching on his own, Oken learns how to
design a temporal device that allowed him to slow down time.
Furthermore, due to his participation in an underground fighting club,
he embeds this device into &lt;strong&gt;Bethany&lt;/strong&gt;, his fighting ninja sword and
uses it to completely obliterate his opponents during their weekly
tournaments. Life looked to be in favor of Oken for a while, specially
when he meets &lt;strong&gt;Jay&lt;/strong&gt; and falls head over heels for the inquisitive
aspiring reporter during one of his fights. But not everything was well,
off course, and unbeknownst to Oken the G-TEP is tipped off by an
unlikely enemy and is planning to take him down as soon as they can
catch him red handed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story itself is very well thought out and I could totally see it
become a mini movie. There are several plot twists and flashbacks to
keep your mind wondering about what the next chapter will bring.
However, I felt that the characters were not properly developed and I
often found myself trying to figure out why some characters acted the
way they did. It’s almost like you’re introduced to a caring and loving
character who, completely out of the blue, turns into a major quantum
physicist and solves a hairy problem in the story and then goes back to
being his old self. There are no explanations before or after the event
as to how this person knows so much about physics or its background. By
now you should all know that I’m all about fully developed characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review may sound a bit on the harsher side but I feel that it is my
obligation to provide my readers with an unbiased review. &amp;nbsp;The plot is
very interesting but the characters could use a bit of a background
boost. In the course of writing the 50 chapters that make up “Emblem
Divide”, Peter’s style gets stronger as the story progresses and by the
end you can see several glimpses of his hard work paying off!&amp;nbsp;If you’re
interested in checking his book, Peter has made it freely accessible in
his &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://emblemdivide.com/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. He has also started working on
his newest project, &lt;strong&gt;Alchemy Reigns&lt;/strong&gt; which you can follow
at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alchemyreigns.wordpress.com/"&gt;alchemyreigns.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, there is a character in “&lt;strong&gt;Emblem Divide&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; that was named
after me! How cool is that? :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I decided to do something I’ve wanted to do for a very long
time: get my own private Linux server! A place where I could have total
control (i.e. root access) and be able to install or run anything I
wanted! Better yet, I wanted a &lt;strong&gt;conary&lt;/strong&gt; managed system that could
leverage all the packaging that I have already done for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.foresightlinux.org"&gt;Foresight
Linux&lt;/a&gt; and be dead simple to maintain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started maintaining some type of a personal web site,
starting with my &lt;strong&gt;AOL&lt;/strong&gt;'s members' pages and eventually “graduating” to
&lt;strong&gt;Geocities&lt;/strong&gt;, it became obvious that sharing the resources of a single
server with who knows how many other people wasn’t going to cut it for
me. Early on there were too many restrictions imposed on anyone who
wanted to “color outside the lines” and today you still have to limit
yourself to a quota (disk, RAM, etc) somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So during the short break I had for last year’s Christmas holidays, I
did a little bit of research looking for something that would be easy to
use and affordable. What I really wanted was to use my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.rpath.org/ui/#/appliances?id=https://www.rpath.org/api/products/djangodevkit"&gt;Django Developer
Kit&lt;/a&gt;
appliance on &lt;strong&gt;EC2&lt;/strong&gt; but that was a bit out of my league at this
juncture. I also thought of using a physical box that I keep in the
closet and see if I could get someone to work out the DNS mapping for
me, but I didn’t really feel comfortable with the implications of asking
such a favor as the first thing people asked for was administrative
access to it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a long story short, I ended up going with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.dreamhost.com/hosting-vps.html"&gt;Dreamhost&lt;/a&gt; since that is
where all of my web sites are currently hosted. At USD $15/month for
300MB I felt that I should be able to host two of my most visited web
sites and an &lt;strong&gt;irssi&lt;/strong&gt; screen session without breaking a sweat. A few
clicks later I was set up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first week with my private server was sheer bliss, specially because
Dreamhost gives you &lt;strong&gt;2300&amp;nbsp;MB&lt;/strong&gt; of RAM free of charge for the first week
so that you can gauge what your needs are. This blog right here, after
migrated, went from choking and giving me 500s &amp;nbsp;whenever I enabled the
&lt;strong&gt;WordPress Stats&lt;/strong&gt; plugin to being super snappy! The other site was
also enjoying solid stability and after 2 weeks of use and studying my
resource consumption patterns, I felt I had made a good choice after
all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That feeling didn’t last long, however. After about 10 days of using my
private server, I realized that both of my sites were down. SSHing to it
showed me that the Apache server had gone down. I quickly got online
with Dreamhost’s support techs and was told that my problem was due to a
run away process that used all of my 300MB and brought the web server
crashing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was pretty disappointing and though I’m not completely ignorant on
how to check system logs I thought that it was pretty safe to believe
the technician. The next few days I experienced slowness to my irssi
session and even a few 500s started creeping up on me. Reluctantly I
turned off the Stats plugin and managed to make the problem go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later I completely lost connection to my system. No SSH
either! The technician was once again summoned and for the next 45
minutes we went back and forth between having connection/access to
seeing my system crash and burn before my own eyes. Now, the technician
was very polite and responsive (as all Dreamhost technicians I’ve dealt
with are) but I just couldn’t get a straight answer as to what was
causing my system to die, even after several reboots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to humor him and followed his suggestion of moving one of my
sites &lt;strong&gt;back&lt;/strong&gt; to the shared environment, only to see the private server
crash again! “Move the second site back too”, he suggested. By this time
I was pretty frustrated with the whole thing and didn’t feel like having
a discussion about how silly this trial and error was. “Go read our wiki
and figure out how to lower your memory consumption”, he offered, to
which I replied: “My systems run ok in the shared server, so it doesn’t
make any sense to me why it would choke when it has 300MB of dedicated
memory. Besides, I’m the customer here and am asking you to help me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, even by moving my second site back to the shared environment
and killing my irssi session, the server would still go down. WTH,
right? So my sad story ends with me cancelling my Private Server and
going back to my shared environment. As I’m no system administrator and
my experience dealing with faulty systems revolve around my day-to-day
maintenance of my personal systems, I never really learned what the
problem was. I expected Dreamhost to provide me with solid information
but was sorely disappointed at their lack of commitment to help me
understand what was wrong. You see, I was ready to accept that, for
whatever reason, 300MB wasn’t enough for my needs. But being told to go
read a wiki page and figure things out on my own was a major let down
for me.&lt;/p&gt;

the third and final book of the Hunger Games series is a fast paced, gut
wrenching story. If the previous book (read my review
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1287"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) left you a bit bored to
tears, this final installment is&amp;nbsp;chock full&amp;nbsp;of violence and action. It
is also where most of the main characters come full circle and show
their true colors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of “&lt;strong&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/strong&gt;”, Katniss plus some of her new
friends were rescued from the dome-shaped arena they were confided in by
fighters from District 13. Peeta, however, &amp;nbsp;was left behind and become
a&amp;nbsp;prisoner&amp;nbsp;of war.&amp;nbsp;Turns out that the inhabitants of District 13&amp;nbsp;were
not destroyed at all by the Capitol and were very much laying low and
waiting for the right moment to start up a revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Katniss gets shipped to District 13 and after going through an
intensive rehabilitation period, she starts to get a better picture of
what her role has been and what is expected of her. Now, if you expect
her to rise up to the occasion and become this super heroine, you’ll be
sorely disappointed. Feeling the weight of knowing that Peeta is most
likely being tortured, not knowing what to expect from District 13’s
leaders, being constantly torn between Gale and Peeta and seeing her
very few friends emotionally and psychologically crippled by the recent
events &amp;nbsp;proves to be too much for her. If in the previous book she was
all about bravery and action, this time she’s a train wreck and will
often be found (or not) hiding and crying in closets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of the book had a few interesting twists and an ending that,
though it may have disappointed some of the readers, felt like a much
more mature and wise in my humble opinion. The interesting thing for me
is that, even though I often blamed the characters for being too
immature or the author for not developing their background in a seamless
manner, I will honestly miss them! After 3 books and 1158 pages it feels
weird to not read about them anymore. Will I recommend this trilogy,
however? Only if you’re a young adult!&lt;/p&gt;

For a while Foresight was indeed a &lt;strong&gt;trail blazer&lt;/strong&gt; and if you wanted to
get the latest and coolest applications or features for Linux, that’s
where you’d go! But nowadays I feel that a lot of the popular
distributions are pretty much shipping the same set of things plus or
minus a feature here or there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=”” align=”alignnone” width=”500” caption=”The many faces of
Foresight Linux”]&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2444/3621581862_edb018d6ef_o_d.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="The many faces of Foresight Linux" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2444/3621581862_e90009822a.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I’d like to tell you about a couple of nice features I came to
grow very fond of after having run &lt;strong&gt;Foresight&lt;/strong&gt; as my main distribution
for the last 3 years. My intention is not to convert anyone but to share
something things I find extremely cool and that may be of your interest
as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason 1 - Rolling releases&lt;/strong&gt;: Because Foresight is based on a
“rolling release” schedule, you don’t have to wait 6 or 12 months to get
your hands on new features or applications! Sure you could download the
source code and compile it yourself or even trust that package that a
friend of a friend told you to install, but I’m talking about having
something that is completely managed by the underlying package
management system! Most of the time new applications are available
within days of being launched as it passes through some spot checking
and QA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason 2 - Roll backs&lt;/strong&gt;: Because the entire system is kept under a
complete version control down to the file level, It is possible to
perform something that other distributions can only dream of: &lt;strong&gt;system
roll backs&lt;/strong&gt;! Don’t like the application you’ve just installed? Remove
it and it will be as if your system never had it installed! Want to go
back to the update you ran &lt;strong&gt;3 weeks&lt;/strong&gt; or even months ago? Not a
problem! Your system is like a giant &lt;strong&gt;Git/Mercurial&lt;/strong&gt; repository and
you control what to clone and what branch to checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason 3 - The Conary Package Management System&lt;/strong&gt;: this is the pixie
dust that makes &lt;strong&gt;Foresight&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;rPath&lt;/strong&gt;'s products run! Created from
the ground up to be the &lt;strong&gt;next generation of package management
systems&lt;/strong&gt; and to provide a platform to create a &lt;strong&gt;true distributed
versioning environment&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary"&gt;Conary&lt;/a&gt;
is definitely worth your time! Prior to using it on a daily basis, I
could never have imagined that I would be able to package anything
(software) in my life, let alone try to create and maintain a
distribution! With its &lt;strong&gt;Pythonic&lt;/strong&gt; style and syntax-like, writing up a
“recipe” for an application is extremely easy to do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason 4: Small crew&lt;/strong&gt;: Foresight is formed by a bunch of very, very
enthusiastic group that really enjoy developing and maintaining a cool
system! That means that we’re small enough to have an almost family-like
relationship and all help out in whatever task needs to be done. That
also means that we’re most of the time shorthanded and have a lot of
things being worked by one single person! Some people may find this to
be a hindrance but I like to see it as a great chance to get involved
with an open source project! Do you want to maintain a package? Want to
impress the world with your artistic skills? Is documentation your
thing? There are very few hoops to jump through and you will learn a
whole lot about Linux and running a distribution! What can I say, we are
a small team that just love what we do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I should also mention that most of our discussions or even
support happens via the irc channel (&lt;strong&gt;#foresight&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;#foresight-devel&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;Freenode&lt;/strong&gt;) and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lists.rpath.org/mailman/listinfo/foresight-devel"&gt;mailing
lists&lt;/a&gt;, but
you are guaranteed to find a courteous and helpful bunch. It is very
captivating, trust me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after I finished reading “&lt;strong&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; (here’s my
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1278"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; in case you’ve missed it) I
decided to move on to the second book of the trilogy to see if this
popular &lt;strong&gt;Young Fiction&lt;/strong&gt; could get me excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Catching-Fire-Second-Hunger-Games/dp/0439023491/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1295318165&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Catching
Fire&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;
is the so called &amp;quot;informational&amp;quot; segment of any trilogy where the author
sheds some more light into the main characters’ history and insights as
to what led them to make certain decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book starts off fairly slowly with &lt;strong&gt;Katniss&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Peeta&lt;/strong&gt;
returning home to D&lt;strong&gt;istrict 12&lt;/strong&gt; after having just outsmarted the
designers of the Hunger Games. But they were mistaken to think that they
could just go back to their normal lives, as their final act was viewed
by many as an act of defiance, &amp;nbsp;and Katniss unwittingly becomes the
symbol of rebellion for the other districts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though they get to move to a new house in a much nicer neighborhood,
plenty of food and amenities, as the current victors they have to go on
tour across all of the remaining districts to serve as a reminder to
others that the Capitol is very much in control of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Katniss struggles to understand her real feelings for &lt;strong&gt;Gale&lt;/strong&gt; and
Peeta, she&amp;nbsp;is one day surprised by a visit from &lt;strong&gt;President&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Snow&lt;/strong&gt;
who stops by to let her know that the Capitol has not taken lightly her
actions and that there will be consequences if she doesn’t perform well
during the tour. Her instructions are very clear: quiet down all talks
and ill feelings from the districts toward the Capitol or suffer the
consequences!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour ends up causing more harm to her already precarious situation
and by the time Katniss and Peeta are back home the damage is already
done. But the Capitol doesn’t take too long to react and comes back with
another twisted plan: A “commemorative edition” of the Hunger Games
where all of the still living previous victors are “invited” back to
compete against each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again Katniss and Peeta have to compete for their lives against a
much more mature and experienced crowd. Alliances and enemies are formed
and broken up at a fairly fast rate and it gets harder and harder to
figure out who is really helping whom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit that the traps are more intriguing this time and the closer
you get to the end of the book, the harder it is to stop reading it. The
end is just as twisted as some of the characters’ personalities and…
Well, I won’t spoil it for you this time! Go get the book from your
public library and let me know what you thought of the second book. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wp.me/pEMZT-ao"&gt;Foresight Linux release&lt;/a&gt;! We have gone
through a lot of changes and it took us a while to rebuild our
developer/maintainer/user base, but here we are! The goal is to go back
to having a rolling release schedule and keep bringing the latest and
greatest mix of GNOME and applications!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was about 4+ years ago that I first started using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.foresightlinux.org"&gt;Foresight
Linux&lt;/a&gt; as my one and only Linux
distribution and I can honestly say that I have never&amp;nbsp;regretted&amp;nbsp;this
decision. I’m also very proud to still be involved with the organization
of our small but dedicated team and I’d like to thank you all for
sticking around and helping maintain our awesome distribution!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my favorite applications have been updated to the very latest
versions, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Banshee&lt;/strong&gt; 1.9.2 (always built from repository),
&lt;strong&gt;Calibre&lt;/strong&gt; 0.7.37 , &lt;strong&gt;Chromium&lt;/strong&gt; webbrowser 9.0.597.55, &lt;strong&gt;F-Spot&lt;/strong&gt;
0.8.2, &lt;strong&gt;Firefox&lt;/strong&gt; 3.6.13, &lt;strong&gt;Git&lt;/strong&gt; 1.7.3.4, &lt;strong&gt;Hotot&lt;/strong&gt; (always built from
repository), &lt;strong&gt;Inkscape&lt;/strong&gt; 0.48 , &lt;strong&gt;Mercurial&lt;/strong&gt; 1.7.2, &lt;strong&gt;OpenOffice.org&lt;/strong&gt;
3.2.1.6+m19, &lt;strong&gt;Pidgin&lt;/strong&gt; 2.7.9, &lt;strong&gt;Shotwell&lt;/strong&gt; 0.7.2, &lt;strong&gt;Terminator&lt;/strong&gt; 0.95,
&lt;strong&gt;Tomboy&lt;/strong&gt; 1.5.2, &lt;strong&gt;Vim&lt;/strong&gt; 7.3.050 and many others!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tired of using that same re-spin of that old Linux distribution? Give
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.foresightlinux.org"&gt;Foresight Linux&lt;/a&gt; a try!

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started reading the “&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Maze-Runner-Trilogy-Book/dp/0385737955/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1294867243&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;The Maze
Runner&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;
trilogy (I’m still waiting for the third and final book to come out),
people have often mentioned about another &lt;strong&gt;sci-fi dystopia&lt;/strong&gt;-like book
that I’d enjoy reading and how I should make a point of reading “&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Games-Book-1/dp/0439023521/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1294867793&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;The
Hunger
Games&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;
by &lt;strong&gt;Suzanne Collins&lt;/strong&gt;. So shortly after getting my &lt;strong&gt;Kindle DX&lt;/strong&gt; I went
out and got all three books that make up this trilogy: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Games-Book-1/dp/0439023521/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_c"&gt;The Hunger
Games&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Catching-Fire-Second-Hunger-Games/dp/0439023491/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b"&gt;Catching
Fire&lt;/a&gt;,
and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Mockingjay-Final-Book-Hunger-Games/dp/0439023513/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b"&gt;Mockingjay&lt;/a&gt;!
Sounds a bit rushed, but I was convinced that I would not regret it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; is the story of &amp;nbsp;a postapocalyptic &lt;strong&gt;United
States.&lt;/strong&gt; The entire country has pretty much crumbled to pieces and the
remaining population gets together and form the new country of
&lt;strong&gt;Panem&lt;/strong&gt;, divided into &lt;strong&gt;13 districts&lt;/strong&gt; and governed by the &lt;strong&gt;Capitol&lt;/strong&gt;
(sounds like the original &lt;strong&gt;13 colonies&lt;/strong&gt;, doesn’t it?). Some time
during the early years of this newly formed nation, those living in
&lt;strong&gt;District 13&lt;/strong&gt; revolt against the Capitol’s politics and in the ensuing
civil war that follows the entire district and its inhabitants are
blasted to&amp;nbsp;smithereens! To top it off, as a way to prevent the other
districts from attempting any type of revolution, the Capitol comes up
with their own version of a &lt;strong&gt;reality show&lt;/strong&gt; where 2 inhabitants from
each of the remaining districts are selected to compete in the Hunger
Games, a sadistic event where competitors are pitted against one another
in a free for all combat and televised 24-hours/day with live
commentary, interviews and gambling. That is where we find &lt;strong&gt;Katniss
Everdeen&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the main characters from the mining district 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that &lt;strong&gt;Prim&lt;/strong&gt;, her younger sister, is the female
representative selected from district 12 but due to the rules of the
game, she gets replaced by her older sister Katniss. Katniss is not your
standard heroin and you will either love her right away or turn your
nose against the way she deals with real life. Together with &lt;strong&gt;Peeta&lt;/strong&gt;,
the male representative from 12, they get shipped to the Capitol
escorted by a mentor, a coach and stylists supposed to turn them into
mean, lean, ready-for-tv gladiators. It is pretty obvious to Katniss and
Peeta that people from the Capitol view the Hunger Games as some sort of
game though the reality is far from it and the only way to “win” is to
be the last person standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually all of the competitors are dumped into a secluded, top of the
art, booby trapped arena where alliances and enemies are created and
destroyed every minute. As the game progresses and the number of living
competitors decrease, we find Katniss and Peeta not only working
together but also pretending to be madly in love with each other in
order to attract sponsors who can send them special packages of much
needed food or medicine to be used during the game. The love scenes are
mixed here and there and there is a subtle but nevertheless ever
presence of a sexual context whenever Katniss and Peeta “play their
role” to the cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, against all the rules, Katniss and Peeta both make it alive
only to see the promise that they could both win the competition taken
away by the game organizers. That is when Katniss tosses a wrench into
things and decides that it is better to die together with Peeta than to
go on knowing that one of them had to die in order for a champion to be
crowned. Seeing this double-suicide attempt, the game organizers quickly
intervene and declare both participants winners of the 74th edition of
the Hunger Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be the end of the book and this story, but as this is a
trilogy, something must happen to allow for a second book, right? Well,
you’ll have to wait for my next review to find out what happened. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have given you a very quick rundown of the plot, here is what
I thought about the book. First off, the story is definitely for a much
younger audience and I often debated whether I should stop reading the
book or just plow through it. Don’t get me wrong, I can see how someone
much younger and looking for a quick and easy futuristic adventure book
sprinkled with a bit of romance would enjoy this book. But compared to
“&lt;strong&gt;The Maze Runner&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; or, to kick things up a notch, &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Win-Cory-Doctorow/dp/B004E3XII0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1294872952&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;For The
Win&lt;/a&gt;”,
this book was very bland and failed to really capture me completely. I
felt that the main characters often acted/behaved much older than their
background allowed for and the final product was something that left
much up in the air. Katniss was supposed to be a good hunter from her
days of hunting rabbits and squirrels on district 12 to feed her family.
But going from that to someone considered to be a valiant and brave
fighter is a bit of a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with all of these things going against it, I chose to read the
second book, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Catching-Fire-Second-Hunger-Games/dp/0439023491/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b"&gt;Catching
Fire&lt;/a&gt;,
because I wanted to give &lt;strong&gt;Suzanne Collins&lt;/strong&gt; another chance and see if
she could win me over. Until my next review…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the holidays I got a second-hand &lt;strong&gt;Kindle DX&lt;/strong&gt; from my
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.productpasha.com/"&gt;sister&lt;/a&gt;. As I have been doing some
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1254"&gt;serious reading&lt;/a&gt; these last couple
of years, an &lt;strong&gt;EBook&lt;/strong&gt; reader was something that both excited and scared
me at the same time. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to carry several books, often pretty thick and heavy, in one
simple and light device has its advantages. Add to that the &lt;strong&gt;massive
number of free EBooks and regular plain text books&lt;/strong&gt; available on web
sites such as the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.archive.org/details/texts"&gt;Internet
Archive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://openlibrary.org/"&gt;Open
Library&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;Project
Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt;, and all of a
sudden we’re talking about having your own private and portable library
on the go! Even &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://amazon.com"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; has several &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html/ref=amb_link_40669842_101?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%2F%3Fnode%3D2245146011&amp;amp;token=3A0F170E7CEFE27BDC730D3D7344512BC1296B83&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=center-5&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=0JHKXGTZSV0D2B7PFQ8B&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=1276331502&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=2245146011"&gt;classic
books&lt;/a&gt;
completely FREE of charge for those who have a &lt;strong&gt;Kindle&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “scary” part, however, is that I actually like the “feel” of paper
between my fingers as I flip the pages of a good book or while I peruse
a newspaper. Call me old fashioned, but I’ve been reading the “old way”
for too long and certain habits are hard to change. There’s also the
fact that, &amp;nbsp;(I wonder if other EBook Readers vendors do the same?) if
Amazon decides to recall a book that is already legally paid for
and&amp;nbsp;downloaded in your Kindle, they can “reach out” and remove it
whenever they feel like it. That alone prevented me from buying a Kindle
and the only reason I now have one is because it was a gift. Talk about
a conflict of interests!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as I drove home after the holidays and spent the night at a hotel
somewhere in Northern Virginia, I proceeded to fill up my device with
books and explore its features. The first thing I did was install
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://calibre-ebook.com/"&gt;Calibre&lt;/a&gt; in my netbook. Since I’m running
bleeding edge &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.foresightlinux.org"&gt;Foresight Linux&lt;/a&gt; I was
able to get a fairly new version installed (and later on that same week
the latest version was available) and off I went to manage the Kindle.
Also, as I keep most of my EBooks in a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.dropbox.com/home"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; directory, adding them was
piece of cake!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must say that the built in &lt;strong&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary&lt;/strong&gt; and the
possibility of getting the definition of the words from the page you’re
reading in one second is very, very handy! There’s also an experimental
&lt;strong&gt;Text to Speech&lt;/strong&gt; feature that I haven’t tried yet but could totally
take advantage of one of these days. Oh, the &lt;strong&gt;battery lasts forever&lt;/strong&gt;
and even though this is not the super small and light &lt;strong&gt;Kindle 3&lt;/strong&gt;, it
still weighs close to nothing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 2 weeks later and I have already read &lt;strong&gt;2 books&lt;/strong&gt; and am
currently working on my third for 2011, a bit ahead of my goal of
reading &lt;strong&gt;52 total books for the year&lt;/strong&gt;! I feel that I am reading a bit
faster now and not straining my eyes as much as before. I still miss
holding a real book every afternoon when I take 1 hour to read. I also
haven’t been to the &lt;strong&gt;Public Library&lt;/strong&gt; this year yet but that aspect is
not going to change as it has become sort of a Sunday ritual for our
family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figure that I may start blogging about the books I read from now on
and provide a small review for anyone interested out there, so expect my
first &lt;strong&gt;book review&lt;/strong&gt; for “&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Games-Book-1/dp/0439023521/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1294760218&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;The Hunger Games (Part
1)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;
&amp;nbsp;fairly soon!&lt;/p&gt;

here at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ogmaciel.com/"&gt;The Journal of an Open Sourcee&lt;/a&gt;!
Because my blog is syndicated by several different aggregators, the
numbers below correspond only to the number of people who actually
clicked their way from the original web site back to my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My server logs, however, show a different picture with much higher
requests and visits for this year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in time before the new year, it is with great pleasure that I
announce the release of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org/"&gt;BillReminder&lt;/a&gt; “&lt;strong&gt;Keep
Their Heads Ringing&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;0.4.0 after a &lt;strong&gt;27-month&lt;/strong&gt; hiatus! During this
period I tried many different approaches and techniques to both improve
the user interface as well as the overall experience. Many of the “core”
changes were performed only to satisfy my own curiosity and
experimentation with other technologies out there, but overall you
should have a good time playing with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org/"&gt;BillReminder&lt;/a&gt; is not a
replacement for your accounting system or elaborate services such as
&lt;strong&gt;Mint.com&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s purpose is to &lt;strong&gt;provide an easy way for getting
notified about upcoming payments keeping yourself ahead of your bills&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BillReminder “Keep Their Heads Ringing” 0.4.0 can be downloaded from:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/BillReminder-0_4_0"&gt;http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/billreminder/0.4/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/hCdgEm"&gt;billreminder-0.4.0.tar.bz2&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;sha256sum&lt;/strong&gt;
6a89584a1c90f661a7954a0c5c8bd392b8e2712d6cfd759fb6e588548ac8ff4e )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/iaxXGG"&gt;billreminder-0.4.0.tar.gz&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;sha256sum&lt;/strong&gt;
9a81ac46f3688a2a25d3114de2ffbc88760ec50d55d12827fc6d83a9859e9cef)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switched most of the user interface code to &lt;strong&gt;Glade&lt;/strong&gt; files with the
hope that&amp;nbsp;it will ease future contributions from ui developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for configuring notification alarms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switched database layer from custom code to &lt;strong&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed license from &lt;strong&gt;BSD&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;GPL v3&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A set of default categories are now created by default on
new&amp;nbsp;installations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better overall data validation when adding or editing bills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed menu to use standard “&lt;strong&gt;File&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; entry instead of
previous&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Bill&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; menu entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrowed &lt;strong&gt;GConf&lt;/strong&gt; handler from the &lt;strong&gt;Conduit&lt;/strong&gt; project and register
gconf schema&amp;nbsp;by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;strong&gt;charting support&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;Hamster&lt;/strong&gt; project for better
visualization of&amp;nbsp;your expenditure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new &lt;strong&gt;calendar widget&lt;/strong&gt; has been added to replace the calendar from
the&amp;nbsp;add/edit dialog. In order to display the calendar, it is
necessary to&amp;nbsp;expand the widget by clicking on the displayed date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recurring bills&lt;/strong&gt; are now handled by selecting a frequency (the
current&amp;nbsp;allowed values are: &lt;strong&gt;once, weekly, and monthly&lt;/strong&gt;) and
setting the end date.&amp;nbsp;Multiple records will then be added using the
start and end date to figure&amp;nbsp;out their correct due date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new &lt;strong&gt;timeline widget&lt;/strong&gt; has been added to replace the calendar from
the main&amp;nbsp;window. You can now use it to change the way you view your
bills by selecting&amp;nbsp;an specific date with a single click as well as
drag the timeline to view past&amp;nbsp;and/or future bills. The following
keyboard shortcuts are available:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;right arrow &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; go to next day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;left arrow &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;go to previous day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ctrl + right &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;go to same day next month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ctrl + left &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; go to same day previous month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;ul class="first"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(plus) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;zoom in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;ul class="first"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(minus) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; zoom out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HOME &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;go to today’s date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PAGEUP &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;scroll to next screen&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PAGEDOWN &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;scroll to previous screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;go to current day plus the number of days displayed in widget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug Fixes&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#551953: It should be possible to add bills without an amount
defined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#553890: Different install/data paths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#554228: Changed Record to Bill to be consistent with nomenclature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#555136: Import sqlite3 if using python 2.5, or pysqlite2 if using
python 2.4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#556748: Don’t try to cast a dbus.String into an int type, if catId
is ‘None’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#561550: Make ‘notes’ widget scroll when number of lines go beyond
the widget’s&amp;nbsp;height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#561751: UI Doesn’t refresh when deleting a record.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#563736: Warn users of overlapping dates for recurring bills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#569023: Timeline widget will not support displaying multiple bills
with&amp;nbsp;different states on the same day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

for letting me bounce ideas whenever I feel like trying some new
approach to a problem!&lt;/p&gt;

resolution&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;2010&lt;/strong&gt; was the ambitious goal of &lt;strong&gt;reading one book
for every week of the year&lt;/strong&gt;! In other words, to read a total of &lt;strong&gt;52
books&lt;/strong&gt; for 2010! I knew that it would be very hard to complete this
resolution without cheating and choosing thin books but I figured:
“&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.quickandsimple.com/fun/inspirational-quotes/aim-moon"&gt;Aim for the moon, that way, even if you miss you’ll still be amongst
the
stars!&lt;/a&gt;”,
right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was around the middle of 2008 that I came up with a plan to “force”
myself to read a book every day. The reason I say “force” is because
since I sit in front of a computer all day long, it was really easy for
me to eat my lunch at my desk and surf the web, read news or spend time
on my pet projects. So I started visiting our public library and picking
up books (or sometimes putting a hold on books that were already out) I
found interesting. Then every day during my lunch break I’d lock my
computer screen and go downstairs to our building’s lobby, sit on the
couch and read! In the beginning I often caught myself checking my email
or doing other things and not really focusing on the book. But after a
while doing this became second nature to my daily routine and now, even
during the weekend, I look forward to my “lunch break” so that I can sit
down, unplug, and dive into a nice book!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on 2010, spurred by all the feelings of change that a new year
brings, I decided I wanted to improve my lifestyle and enjoy life and my
family to the fullest. So I looked into books about happiness and
getting rid of bad and annoying habits. I also wanted to keep reading
about history, one of my favorite topics, specially about U.S. history.
Finally, I wanted to go back to reading some of the classics, those
books I’ve always wanted to read but felt that I didn’t have enough time
for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, as the months progressed, I started gravitating
towards fiction and some of the newly published books, such as &lt;strong&gt;Stieg
Larsson&lt;/strong&gt;'s trilogy and even the entire &lt;strong&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/strong&gt; saga!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only a couple of weeks left until the end of the year, I have now
read a total of &lt;strong&gt;31 books&lt;/strong&gt; and approximately &lt;strong&gt;13360 pages&lt;/strong&gt; and still
have another book to finish, &lt;strong&gt;Ken Follett&lt;/strong&gt;'s &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fall-Giants-Century-Trilogy-Follett/dp/0525951652/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1292335688&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;Fall of
Giants&lt;/a&gt;.
I also have a couple of other books I’d like to squeeze in before the
end of the year, but I may have to wait for our public library to get
them for me through their intralibrary load program. At the very top of
this list I have &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Lifecycle-Software-Objects-Ted-Chiang/dp/1596063173/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1292335907&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;The Lifecycle of Software
