&lt;img alt="Podcasts" src="https://omaciel.fedorapeople.org/podcast-image.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone who has run his own &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://castalio.info/"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; for several years (albeit
not generating a lot of content lately), it took me quite some time to
actually start &lt;em&gt;listening&lt;/em&gt; to podcasts myself. Ironic, I know, but I
guess the main reason behind this was because I was always reading
code at work and eventually, no matter how hard I tried, I just
couldn't pay attention to what was being said! No matter how
interesting the topic being discussed was or how engaging the hosts
(or hosts) were, my brain would be so focused on reading code that
everything else just turned into white noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, fast forward a couple of years and I still am reading code
(though not as much as I used to due to a new role), and I still have
a hard time listening to podcast while at work... so I decided to only
listen to them when I was &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; working. Simple, right? But it took
me a while to change that for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I now listen to podcasts while driving (which I don't really
do a lot of since I work from home 99.99% of the time) or when I go
for walks, and after a while I have started following a handful of
them which are now part of my weekly routine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bookriot.com/listen/shows/allthebooks"&gt;All The Books&lt;/a&gt; which provide me with an up to date list of
suggestions for what books to read next. They're pretty regular with
their episodes, so I can always count on listening about new books
pretty much every week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bookriot.com/listen/shows/thepodcast"&gt;Book Riot&lt;/a&gt; for another dose of more news about books!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hacktheentrepreneur.com/"&gt;Hack the Entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt; to keep up with people who are making
something about what they are passionate about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://howwegettonext.com/tagged/wonderland-podcast"&gt;Wonderland Podcast&lt;/a&gt; which I only started listening to a few weeks
back but it has turned into one of my favorite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://soundcloud.com/science-vs"&gt;Science Vs&lt;/a&gt; another new addition to my list, with entertaining
takes at interesting topics such as 'the G-spot', 'Fracking', 'Gun
Control' and 'Organic Food'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I was introduced to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia"&gt;Invisibilia&lt;/a&gt; and though I only listened to
the first 10 minutes (I was giving the link during working hours, so
no go for me), I'm already very interested and will follow it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have other podcasts that I am still subscribed to, but these
listed here are the ones that I am still following every episode.
Maybe if I had to drive to work every day or went for walks more
often, maybe then I would listen to more podcasts? Trust me though, I
rather continue listening to only a small set of them than drive to
work every day. Don't get me wrong, I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; going to work, but
that's 2 hours/day of my life that I rather spend at home :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about you? What podcasts do you find yourself going back to every
time a new episode is published? Would you mind sharing your
suggestions (and why you like the podcasts) with me here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Review of 2015" src="https://omaciel.fedorapeople.org/bookshelf.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another year has gone by and I guess it is time to review the things I
set out to do and grade myself on how well (or poorly) I fared. Here
are some of my goals for 2015:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="read-70-books"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Read 70 Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grade: &lt;strong&gt;PASS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I had a very, very busy year at work, with many releases
of &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat Satellite 5&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat Satellite 6&lt;/strong&gt; shipped to our
customers, I managed to surpass my goal of reading 70 books, finishing
the year with a whopping &lt;strong&gt;79&lt;/strong&gt; books read! You can see the books I
read here: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2015/12048315"&gt;Year in Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I also spent a good chunk of my time looking at old, used
books, and my personal book collection increased considerably. At one
point I had so many piles of books lying around the house that I had
to buy 4 new book cases to store them. At first I wanted to have them
custom made, but the estimates I got from 3-4 different people were
way out of my budget. In the end I went with 4 &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40279788/#/40263848"&gt;Billy Bookcases&lt;/a&gt; from
Ikea, which cost me about 10 times less!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see what I'm reading or want to recommend a book which
you think I might enjoy reading, please feel free to add me on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/omaciel"&gt;GoodReads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="write-a-book"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Write a Book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grade: &lt;strong&gt;FAIL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I utterly failed my attempt, or better yet, lack of attempt to write a
book. I did have lots of ideas for some short stories, but it was only
around &lt;strong&gt;July&lt;/strong&gt; that I started writing them in my notebook. I have
around 3-4 rough drafts put together and I hope that I can transcribe
them from the notebook onto another media, perhaps this blog?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="travel-abroad"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Travel Abroad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grade: &lt;strong&gt;PASS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I had the opportunity of doing a bit of traveling, and I
already have a couple of trips planned for the new year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;February: I went back to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno"&gt;Brno&lt;/a&gt; in the Czech Republic for work, and
attended the very first &lt;strong&gt;QE Camp&lt;/strong&gt; organized by my employer, &lt;strong&gt;Red
Hat&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though &lt;strong&gt;British Airlines&lt;/strong&gt; misplaced my luggage and I
had to wear the same clothes for 3 days while attending the event (I
washed my socks and tidy whities every night and hung them to dry
overnight). It was pretty cold too and I had to make do with a
&lt;strong&gt;UNC&lt;/strong&gt; sweater I had on me. Anyhow, I absolutely &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno"&gt;Brno&lt;/a&gt;
and it was great that I got to work from the office for a few days
and hang out with my fellow Red Hatters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://photos-4.dropbox.com/t/2/AABWqCX-YXi5QB4nFRGrIbEHiTLkzW5pRppen8aeuMqsxQ/12/102224/jpeg/32x32/3/1451620800/0/2/2015-02-08%2012.38.14.jpg/EMutJxjF6ozdBCACKAI/9f9ZtckqDadXsKolbkor5J16LSIA4jQpHlV8Dk9s6Fo?size_mode=3&amp;amp;size=1024x768" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May&lt;/strong&gt;: This time I went to Israel for the first time. It was a very
long flight and when I finally arrived at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Gurion_Airport"&gt;Ben Gurion&lt;/a&gt; airport I
was very tired. I also could not get my cel phone to work there and
since the address to my hotel was in an email from work, I had to
resort to hand gestures and appeal to the good will of others to
figure out that my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://benjamin-hotel.co.il/"&gt;hotel&lt;/a&gt; was in &lt;strong&gt;Herzliya&lt;/strong&gt; and not &lt;strong&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/strong&gt;
as I kept insisting with the cab driver. :) He finally let me use
his iPhone to go online and I arrived safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must say
that I had a great time in Israel, even with the day long meetings
we had every single day. This was the first time I spent a lot of
time with my manager too, and I must say that it was a great
opportunity to see him performing his job, day in, day out. He is
very passionate about his job, but he is also very approachable and
genuinely cares about us, so by the end of the week I felt that the
trip was worth the long distance and all the meetings. I also gave a
presentation about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite"&gt;Red Hat Satellite 6&lt;/a&gt; and talked about some of
the new features that we were working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://photos-6.dropbox.com/t/2/AAB4e0nWWSoPTroflxZ4c-DirAJ1bi0z83tNzG5JIUb7Og/12/102224/jpeg/32x32/3/1451620800/0/2/pavel_og_israel_2015.jpg/EMutJxjF6ozdBCACKAI/KZsuflf14H5ZKHN4hVR1RuSgNNQyhGZcInq4bdyl2_o?size_mode=3&amp;amp;size=1024x768" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I got to meet some
of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://theforeman.org/"&gt;The Foreman&lt;/a&gt; developers in person and it is always great to
be able to meet those folks I spent all year long bugging via
&lt;strong&gt;IRC&lt;/strong&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;July: Another trip to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno"&gt;Brno&lt;/a&gt;, this time for a bunch of meetings
with my &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat Satellite 5 QE&lt;/strong&gt; teammates. The weather was
fantastic and I even managed to meet with some folks whom I had only
interacted online and some old friends from my &lt;strong&gt;GNOME&lt;/strong&gt; days who
now work for &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt;. I was given the opportunity to manage the
&lt;cite&gt;Pulp&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;strong&gt;QE&lt;/strong&gt; team (and I'm still looking for experienced &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;
developers in the Czech Republic or willing to relocate there!) and
once again got to hang out with friends, co-workers and do a bit of
sightseeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://photos-5.dropbox.com/t/2/AADDN3oAIeZ-3SRcIhfiiaBKtNXtsoDcqkSd6AdYUEh0yQ/12/102224/jpeg/32x32/3/1451620800/0/2/2015-07-16%2017.44.48.jpg/EMutJxjF6ozdBCACKAI/8eaPbviOw1vqHDtp3wjDTpjTFVvlmYthCLyXtjdTdrg?size_mode=3&amp;amp;size=1024x768" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;August: Took some time off from work and took the family to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Beach%2C_North_Carolina"&gt;Carolina Beach&lt;/a&gt; for a few days. Got a lot reading done and enjoyed a much needed rest watching the kids running around on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://photos-4.dropbox.com/t/2/AAC7a4q4B-1VXc0b6aovCtuK9BXoR2D-JaHi1cIrXA-ZXw/12/102224/jpeg/32x32/3/1451620800/0/2/2015-08-01%2015.26.31.jpg/EMutJxjF6ozdBCACKAI/rNRNleyOfijr1kUgPYSBx2t5nZ6DUqE5vgdqQcBPLb4?size_mode=3&amp;amp;size=1024x768" /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had an opportunity to visit my teammates in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune"&gt;Pune&lt;/a&gt;, India, but decided that I had enough traveling for this year and postponed my trip for next year. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="become-a-better-manager"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Become a Better Manager&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grade: &lt;strong&gt;In Progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I officially became a manager (with about 24 people from 5 different timezones reporting directly to me) I realized that I had to make some changes to my day to day activities in order to be (or attempt to be) a good manager. Some of them were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delegate more: stop doing the day to day activities related to testing our products and/or related to automating functional tests, and focus on coaching folks to do them for me while I focused on other activities that required my attention and time. I must say, I still struggle with this, but only because I have a very hands on approach to work. Luckily for me, I have a great team and lots of support from my own manager, so I feel that I'm moving in the right direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take classes: this year I took several classes provided by Red Hat that were geared toward helping me build strong professional relationships with my teammates and other folks across different teams. I also learned how to build &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Win-Win contracts&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;, create &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria"&gt;SMART&lt;/a&gt; goals and have &lt;strong&gt;Crucial Conversations&lt;/strong&gt;. Even though most of the material covered in these classes were nothing new to me, it was nevertheless a great reminder and incentive to start using these techniques at work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incentive teammates to aim higher: throughout the entire year we were faced with many challenges, and I had the opportunity to work with many talented folks. It is such a great feeling coming to work and knowing that everyone around you is just as passionate (or more) about what they do as you are! There are times, however, when folks are not always at their best or some times get a bit lost and lose focus. As a manager I had the opportunity to lend a helping hand within my team and outside to some folks who needed a bit of encouragement and validation about their performance. I spend a huge chunk of 2015 talking to folks, in person or through video conference, listening to their issues and working with them on a plan of attack to help them turn things around. I remember very clearly the many times I struggled with a particular task or role at previous jobs, and how much I wished someone would only listen to me and help me through a rough patch, so I dedicate a lot of my time to being around and available to everyone around. Sometimes it can take several months to tilt the scale to the right direction, but when it happens, it is very gratifying to see the positive effect that it has on folks lives. This is probably the most gratifying thing about being a manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm truly excited about the new year that is about to begin and I have many plans to travel more and spend more time with family, friend and teammates! The year of 2015 was a blast and I hope you all have something to be grateful as well. See you all in 2016!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;August 2015&lt;/strong&gt; I took a break from work and spent about 6 days
enjoying some R&amp;amp;R down the North Carolina shore with my family. I
managed to get through some of the books that were waiting for a long
time for me to get to them, as well as try some new authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="read"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Read&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+Sentinel"&gt;The Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Arthur+C.+Clarke"&gt;Arthur C. Clarke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forgot where I read about how the short story &amp;quot;The Sentinel&amp;quot; was the inspiration for &amp;quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&amp;quot;, but being that I have always considered the latter a great book and movie, I managed to grab a copy of the anthology &amp;quot;The Sentinel&amp;quot; just so that I could read the short story by the same name and see what else Arthur C. Clarke &amp;quot;had to offer.&amp;quot; Interestingly enough (to me), most if not all the other short stories included in this collection could easily be published today and still feel just as futuristic as they probably were back when they were first published! This was yet another one of the books that I read by the beach this Summer and though it didn't blow me away, it was still a very relaxing read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=A+Princess+of+Mars"&gt;A Princess of Mars&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Edgar+Rice+Burroughs"&gt;Edgar Rice Burroughs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last June I got from my family for my birthday &amp;quot;John Carter of Mars&amp;quot; containing the complete series and I was just itching for a good opportunity to start reading it. That chance came up this week as I started reading some of Melville's short stories and found that I needed a bit of a &amp;quot;break&amp;quot;. First off, I have never read Edgar Rice Burroughs before but I do have a copy of &amp;quot;Tarzan of the Apes&amp;quot; also awaiting for a chance, so I had an idea about what to expect from his style. Sure enough, reading &amp;quot;A Princess of Mars&amp;quot; felt like a taking a trip down memory's lane, back when it was easy to tell who the good and the bad guys were, and there was always a damsel in distress somewhere waiting to be rescued. I have to confess that it took me a few chapters to get re-acclimated with this style, but once I got into it, it was easy reading, which is exactly what I was looking for any how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Carter, the main character, shows all the expected, cliché virtues one would expect from a &amp;quot;hero&amp;quot; but one thing that bothered me a bit was the language he used to describe those who were different from him (which was mostly everyone in the story, since they were all Martians) and the way he treated them. It felt a bit abusive and even a but racist? I don't know if someone could get away with writing in the same style today, but then again I remembered that back then people were not as politically correct as we are today... or maybe I was reading too much into it? Anyhow, it was a fun read and I think I will try to add the next 4 books of the series in the coming months so that I can hopefully get a better opinion formed about the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Vidas+Secas"&gt;Vidas Secas&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Graciliano+Ramos"&gt;Graciliano Ramos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first time reading Graciliano Ramos but I knew about this book from other folks who read it growing up for school. This is the story about how Fabiano, Vitoria, their two small children, &amp;quot;baleia&amp;quot; (whale) the dog and a parrot find themselves fighting for their lives (the parrot is not so lucky and quickly becomes dinner before the end of the first chapter) as they wonder one of the most desolate and arid regions of Brazil, in search for a job and a chance for survival. The characters are presented one by one, as the author allows us a glimpse of their lives and most inner thoughts (or lack of) as if seen from their own eyes. Their lack of communication skills (they mostly understand each other through grunts and gestures), poverty (all Vitoria wants is a bed that doesn't have a wood slat with a big knot in the middle which forces her to sleep sideways and in a fetal position) and failed ambitions as well as how fragile and dependent on the weather (no rain means no water for the farm animals and therefore no job security for Fabiano) their lives are reminded me a lot of &amp;quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a window into what it was like to be poor in the Northeastern region of Brazil at the turn of last century and I wonder how much of it may still be true nowadays?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Cannery+Row"&gt;Cannery Row&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=John+Steinbeck"&gt;John Steinbeck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great book by the master! I read this book while enjoying a much needed vacation with my family, and I couldn't have chosen a better book. Though the plot itself may look a bit too simple at a glance to interest anyone who is not familiar with Steinbeck, he more than makes up for it by providing a nice list of colorful characters, places (a whorehouse named &amp;quot;Bear Flag Restaurant&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Palace Flophouse&amp;quot; where Mac and possibly leader of a small group of vagrants) and events that take place along &amp;quot;cannery row&amp;quot;, a street lined with shabby stores that mostly cater to those who work and earn their living from the many sardine canneries in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed reading about each one of the characters and how Stenibeck, masterfully as always, brings them all together in a party to end all parties! I was often reminded of another one of his books, &amp;quot;Tortilla Flat&amp;quot;, which I also strongly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Neverwhere"&gt;Neverwhere&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Neil+Gaiman"&gt;Neil Gaiman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never read &amp;quot;Neverwhere&amp;quot; the first time it was published in the late 1990s and had zero knowledge about its plot, so I had the advantage of reading this &amp;quot;for the first time&amp;quot; while sipping drinks by the North Carolina coast :) This story has a bit of everything: angels, demons, wild beasts, hunters, warriors, talking mice and a common Londoner named Richard Mayhew, who find himself the unwilling rescuer and then adventure partner of Door (yes, that is her name), the remaining member of a family from Neverwhere. To go back to his old life, he must help Door escape from two demoniacal assassins and find out the truth about the murder of her family. Entertaining and, in my humble opinion, another good example of why Neil Gaiman deserves a spot amongst the best sci-fi writers ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Zen+and+the+Art+of+Motorcycle+Maintenance:+An+Inquiry+Into+Values"&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Robert+M.+Pirsig"&gt;Robert M. Pirsig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was with a bit of trepidation that I started this book, being that there was a lot of hype about it and the assumptions I had made from this hype and what the 'Zen' part of its title implied. My concern being that I didn't want to set myself for disappointment if the book didn't live up to the (very) high expectations I had. I must say, this book is very dense and it was not an easy read... for me at least. Intermingled with the story of the father-son duo traveling through several states on their way West, there are many inner monologues where we learn A LOT about ancient philosophy and how the relentless pursuit of understanding Quality and Truth by the father affected his life and those around him. I had to make a point of finding a quiet place AND a quiet time to read this book just in order to keep up with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that to categorize this book and give it a &amp;quot;grade&amp;quot; without the benefit of having enough time to thoroughly &amp;quot;digest&amp;quot; it is a nearly impossible task to achieve, but the one thing I can say is that I feel that I learned a lot more about philosophy than I thought I was able to, mostly because of the way ideas and terms were described by the author. I also enjoyed how the relationship between father and son was developed and how it all came together in the end, by which time I was reading as fast as I could, barely able to contain my curiosity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is &amp;quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&amp;quot; for the 'faint of heart'? Probably not. I think that the analogy where wines get better with age is applicable here, where you, the reader, is the 'wine' and you must be at a later time in your life to truly be able to grasp what this book is all about. I may be giving it another go later on just to see what other things I may find, once I give myself enough time to (hopefully) grow wiser and have more 'miles' to show for. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+Lottery:+And+Other+Stories"&gt;The Lottery: And Other Stories&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Shirley+Jackson"&gt;Shirley Jackson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two main reasons why I decided to read this book: 1) I read &amp;quot;We Have Always Lived in the Castle&amp;quot; this month and was moderately interested in Shirley Jackson's style, and 2) I heard about the story &amp;quot;The Lottery&amp;quot; from my wife, which only helped peak my curiosity. So I borrowed the book from the public library and went straight to &amp;quot;The Lottery&amp;quot;, which happens to be the very last story in the book. This story gave me, once again, a good taste for her ability to describe places, characters, and what may seem at fist a very mundane scene and... WHAMMO, hit you with a plot twist that catches you unaware and gasping for air. &amp;quot;This book should be a thrilling roller-coaster ride,&amp;quot; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, to be honest I felt that &amp;quot;The Lottery&amp;quot; was by far the darkest of the whole lot. The rest of the other stories, for the most part, were very well thought out, organized and with a plot twist in the end, but the surprises were of a different type: they leave you wondering if you missed something and the questions &amp;quot;what just happened here?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;huh???&amp;quot; were frequently uttered by yours truly as I read the entire book. Most stories do show a hint of weirdness and sometimes the creepiness is very subtle... but just when you think you know where you're headed and you find yourself bracing for the end, she blindfolds you, spins you around 10 times and leaves you in a totally different place, time and with a strange taste in your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think that after all this I would now proclaim that I would never touch one of her stories... but to be honest, I find that I'm even more interested to learn about this author and this style of hers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=We+Have+Always+Lived+in+the+Castle"&gt;We Have Always Lived in the Castle&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Shirley+Jackson"&gt;Shirley Jackson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first Shirley Jackson book and I was a bit confused about her style and if this was perhaps a precursor to what we now call Young Fiction? I think what really threw me off a bit was the 'child-like' language used between Mary Katherine &amp;quot;Merricat&amp;quot; Blackwood and Constance, the two sisters who are the main protagonists in this story, and how it contrasted with the plot itself. Since this book was published in the early 1960s and touches on the topic of human persecution usually experienced when people find you to be &amp;quot;different than the norm&amp;quot;, the dialogues between &amp;quot;Merricat&amp;quot; and the other characters made it all sound like she was a younger girl than she really was (she's supposed to be 18-years-old if I'm not mistaken). There's also a string touch of what I am going to loosely call &amp;quot;weird fiction&amp;quot;, as for instance when she keeps talking to her pet cat as if it were a real person capable of not only understanding her but also making intelligent comments and replies that only she could hear. Or how, despite all the weird things going around them and how they live completely isolated from everyone, everyone in the Blackwood household goes on about their day as if everything was normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I think what really captivated me about this book (and made me go back for more later on) was, funny enough, this mix of dark and weird and I think I also got my first glimpse at the way most of Shirley Jackson's stories end, hanging you out there and wondering &amp;quot;WTF?&amp;quot; :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;July 2015&lt;/strong&gt; I travelled to the &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt; office in &lt;strong&gt;Brno, Czech Republic&lt;/strong&gt; to spend some time with my teammates there, and I managed to get a lot of reading done between long plane rides and being jet lagged for many nights :) So I finally managed to finish up some of the books that had been lingering on my &lt;em&gt;ToDo&lt;/em&gt; list and even managed to finally read a few of the books that together make up the &lt;strong&gt;Chronicles of Narnia&lt;/strong&gt;, since I had never read them as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;

S. Lewis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all the books I read this month, I feel that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=All+Quiet+on+the+Western+Front"&gt;All Quiet on the Western Front&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+October+Country"&gt;The October Country&lt;/a&gt; were the ones I enjoyed reading the most, closely followed by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Cryptonomicon"&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/a&gt;, which took me a while to get through. The other books, with the exception of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+Memoirs+of+Sherlock+Holmes"&gt;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&lt;/a&gt;, helped me pass the time when I only wanted to be entertained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=All+Quiet+on+the+Western+Front"&gt;All Quiet on the Western Front&lt;/a&gt; takes the prize for being one of the best books I have ever read! I felt that the way &lt;strong&gt;WWI&lt;/strong&gt; was presented through the eyes of the main character was a great way to represent all the pain, angst and suffering that all sides of conflict went through, without catering for any particular side or having an agenda. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Erich+Maria+Remarque"&gt;Erich Maria Remarque&lt;/a&gt;'s style had me some times breathless, some times with a knot on the pit of my stomach I as 'endured' the many life changing events that took place in the book. Is this an action-packed book about WWI? Will it read like a thriller? In my opinion, even though there are many chapters with gory details about killings and battles, the answer is a very bland 'maybe'. I think that the real 'star' of this book is its philosophical view of the war and how the main characters, all around 19-20 years of age, learn to deal with its life lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I have been a huge fan of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Ray+Bradbury"&gt;Ray Bradbury&lt;/a&gt; for a while now, and when I got &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+October+Country"&gt;The October Country&lt;/a&gt; for my birthday last month, I just knew that it would be time well spent reading it. For those of you who are more acquainted his science fiction works, this book will surprise you as it shows you a bit of  his 'darker' side. All of the short stories included in this collection deal with death, mysterious apparitions, inexplicable endings and are sure to spook you a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Cryptonomicon"&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/a&gt; was at times slow, some other times funny and, especially toward the end, a very entertaining book. Weighing in at a hefty 1000 pages (depending on the edition you have, plus/minus 50 odd pages), this book covers two different periods in the lives of a number of different characters, past (around &lt;strong&gt;WWII&lt;/strong&gt;) and present, all different threads eventually leading to a great finale. Alternating between past and present, the story takes us to the early days of how &lt;strong&gt;cryptology&lt;/strong&gt; was 'officially invented' and used during the war, and how many of the events that took place back then were affecting the lives of some of the direct descendants of the main characters in our present day. As you go through the back and forth you start to gather bits and pieces of information that eventually connects all the dots of an interesting puzzle. It definitely requires a long term commitment to go though it, but it was enjoyable and, as I mention before, it made me laugh at many places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verdict is still out for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Armada"&gt;Armada&lt;/a&gt;, maybe because I had very high expectations for it after reading &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Ready+Player+One"&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/a&gt; last December. You still see a ton of references to the 80s but the main focus seems to be dedicated to videogames, old and new, and how the main character, Zach Lightman, learns that all the numerous hours he spent in front of his computer pays off when a bunch of aliens one day decide to visit Earth with not so friendly intentions. The book reads a lot like &lt;strong&gt;Enders Game&lt;/strong&gt;, which I didn't quite enjoy to be honest. I just can't relate to books where the main character is a very young and immature person who all of a sudden has these 'mad skills' that puts them in a position to take charge of whole armies! Now, I understand that this is a work of science fiction and that it is not supposed to match reality, etc, etc, and I tried to keep this in mind all the while I read the book. But things happened way too quickly and without having more information (chapters?) showing how a kid who &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; plays videogames 'for a living' can acquire the skills and experience required to get to where he got, the whole story felt too... artificial? Anyhow, even with all these issues I still managed to enjoy the book, mostly because of the 80s references. I gave it 3 (out of 5) starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reading"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=S"&gt;S&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=J.+J.+Abrams"&gt;J. J. Abrams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=S"&gt;S&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Fluent+Python"&gt;Fluent Python&lt;/a&gt; are books that I have been chipping away for close to two months now... the real reason why it is taking me a while to get through them is two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=S"&gt;S&lt;/a&gt; reads like a huge puzzle/detective board game and it really requires a lot of work to get through. For every actual page of story, there are dozens of messages and notes scribbled on the side and in the margins which, once you put them together, should guide you to the solution of a mystery hidden underneath it all. It is slow reading, and since I usually read to relax after a long day of work, I find myself shying away from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Fluent+Python"&gt;Fluent Python&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt; technical book. I use &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt; at work. See my point above about reading to relax :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself with about US$100 left in credits for my &lt;strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/strong&gt; account, which is always dangerous with me... and to make things 'worse', two promising books were released this July 14th: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Go+Set+a+Watchman"&gt;Go Set a Watchman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Armada"&gt;Armada&lt;/a&gt;. Up until then I was doing pretty good actually, only buying three used books... but then, on the 14th, BOOM! Since I bought &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Armada"&gt;Armada&lt;/a&gt; I figured I just had to also get &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Ready+Player+One"&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/a&gt; (which I read last December and loved it)... and my &lt;strong&gt;GoodReads&lt;/strong&gt; list happened to be open too, so I went ahead and got &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+War+of+the+End+of+the+World"&gt;The War of the End of the World&lt;/a&gt;, not to mention that I pre-order another book and a magazine!!! However, and I am proud to say this, I still managed to get around US$17 left... which is still very dangerous :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about you? What kind of interesting books have you read this past month???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you who know me know that I am a huge book reader and spend most of my free time reading several books at the same time. One could say that reading is one of my passions, and having wasted so many years after high school completely ignoring this passion (in exchange for spending most of my time trying to learn about &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt;, get an education, a job and, let's be frank, chasing after girls), I decided that something had to be done about it, and starting around 2008 I 'forced' myself to dedicate at least one solid hour of reading &lt;strong&gt;for fun&lt;/strong&gt; every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it funny to say that I had to &lt;strong&gt;force&lt;/strong&gt; myself, but this statement is very much true. Being so used to spending all of my time sitting in front of a computer and getting flooded with information every single minute of the day (IRC, Twitter, Facebook, commit emails, RSS feeds, etc), I found it difficult to 'unplug' and spend time doing nothing but focusing on only one thing. I was so used to multitasking and being constantly bombarded with lots of information that sitting quietly and reading didn't feel very productive to me... sad but true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, after several 'agonizing' months of getting up from my desk and making a point of turning off my cel phone and finding a quiet place somewhere in the building (or at home during the weekends), I finally got into the habit of reading for pleasure. I actually looked forward to these reading periods (imagine that, huh?) and eventually I realized that if I skipped  this 'ritual' even one day, my days felt like they got longer and I felt stressed out and irritable for the remaining of the day. Reading became not only a good habit but my mechanism for relaxing and recharging my energies during the day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this passion and appetite for reading has only gotten bigger, and with time I have to say that it has become a pretty big part of who I am today! In a way I am happy that it took me this long to get back into the habit of reading... I mean, I feel that getting older was an important part of preparing myself so that I could really appreciate &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=John+Steinbeck"&gt;John Steinbeck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Ray+Bradbury"&gt;Ray Bradbury&lt;/a&gt; and the likes of them! Would I have truly appreciated &lt;strong&gt;The Grapes of Wrath&lt;/strong&gt; when I was younger? Perhaps... but it took me around 40 years to get to it and I'm happy that when it did I was able to appreciate this amazing piece of art!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These last few months I decided that I wanted to start tracking all the books that I read, buy or receive as a gift every month (see my reading progress on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12048315-og-maciel"&gt;GoodReads&lt;/a&gt; and add me as a friend), and jot down some of my impressions and motives for reading or buying them. Those familiar with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Nick+Hornby"&gt;Nick Hornby&lt;/a&gt; will probably associate this post (and hopefully others that will surely come) with the work he has done writing for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.believermag.com/"&gt;Believer Magazine&lt;/a&gt; ... and this would be correct. My intention is not to copy his style or anything like that, but I thought that the format he chose to report on his own reading 'adventures' would fit in quite nicely with what I wanted to get across to my readers... and I'm sticking with the format as long as it works for me :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since June was a very busy book buying/getting month for me (mostly because it was my birthday and I used that as an excuse to go overboard and get lots of books), here is my summary for everything that happened on the reading front. By the way, if you want to get me a book from my &lt;strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://amzn.com/w/32BX7VP2GEFI1"&gt;Wish List&lt;/a&gt;, by all means, do so :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="read"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Read&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Wise+Blood"&gt;Wise Blood&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Flannery+O'Connor"&gt;Flannery O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+Open+Organization"&gt;The Open Organization&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Jim+Whitehurst"&gt;Jim Whitehurst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to last month (and I did write a post about it, but only in Portuguese), it may look like I didn't get a lot of reading done in June, but that is not quite true. Further down you'll see that I've been reading a pretty thick book with around 910 pages &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;, as usual, I am also reading several books at the same time... and did not finish them before the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+Open+Organization"&gt;The Open Organization&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Jim+Whitehurst"&gt;Jim Whitehurst&lt;/a&gt;, current CEO for &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt; (where I work since 2011), I got when the book was launched a few weeks ago. The reason why I chose to put it at the top of my reading list had nothing to do with the fact that it was written by my boss' boss :) but mostly because it talked about certain topics which are very close to my personal interests. The topics discussed are not necessarily new to me, but they are part of my day-to-day routine and I get to practice a lot of them every day. The concept of &lt;strong&gt;meritocracy&lt;/strong&gt; is embedded into the DNA of everyone who works at &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt; and it was very interesting to see how this culture affected and shaped &lt;strong&gt;Jim Whitehurst&lt;/strong&gt;'s career when he joined this company after joining us from &lt;strong&gt;Delta&lt;/strong&gt;. The cultural shock through which he went through reminded me of a similar experience I had when I moved to North Carolina and joined &lt;strong&gt;rPath&lt;/strong&gt;. Many of the names cited throughout the book are people that I have met and worked with in the past almost 4 years, which lent to the reading experience a feeling of closeness and being part of a bigger entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Wise+Blood"&gt;Wise Blood&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Flannery+O'Connor"&gt;Flannery O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; was recommended by my wife, and since I had already read other stories by &lt;strong&gt;Flannery O'Connor&lt;/strong&gt; (and was deeply impressed with the very story I read, &lt;strong&gt;A Good Man is Hard to Find&lt;/strong&gt;) I figured that it was a good opportunity to read a bit more of her stories. As in most of the her previous work (that I read), there is a very strong theme around religion present that permeates and affects, not always in a positive manner, her characters. The scenery and characters are also based in the southern region of the United States, and it's really amazing how well she manages to capture the essence of the south! Unfortunately I felt that the book's plot didn't always make a lot of sense, oftentimes with events that did not seem to add anything to the main story and characters that simply disappeared from the book without a trace or impact on the story itself. It was only after I took some time to research a bit that I learned that this book seems to have been made by several other stories that the author wrote earlier in her career, and were &amp;quot;hammered&amp;quot; together to create a book. Anyway, I recommend this writer if you haven't already read her, and I strongly recommend &lt;strong&gt;A Good Man is Hard to Find&lt;/strong&gt; for being very &amp;quot;dark&amp;quot; and a perfect example of her style!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I barely touched in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+Memoirs+of+Sherlock+Holmes"&gt;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&lt;/a&gt; this month, especially since, as I said in a previous article, I was not impressed with the stories and found them to be mostly super dull. Let's see if I will finish it ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Luciano+Ramalho"&gt;Luciano Ramalho&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Fluent+Python"&gt;Fluent Python&lt;/a&gt; was another that I barely opened, but for much different reasons. The problem was finding free time to read a technical book, after spending the entire month solving problems at work. All my spare time was spent reading things that relaxed me and I made a great effort to disconnect myself from any issues that were related to work. But the book is great and I'll finish it for sure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=Cryptonomicon"&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/a&gt; is the book that I mentioned before to be huge (910 pages in the edition I have) and has taken much of my reading time. I usually read it at night and before going to bed. The story is very interesting and it is easy to see why so many people suggest it for those who love science fiction. Mixing a little history of &lt;strong&gt;World War II&lt;/strong&gt;, with characters from real life, and technologies that are part of our life today, I have read this book slowly, enjoying each chapter and revelations. I'm almost on page 600 :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=S"&gt;S&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=J.+J.+Abrams"&gt;J. J. Abrams&lt;/a&gt; has been the most difficult book to read! Not that it is annoying (as &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=The+Memoirs+of+Sherlock+Holmes"&gt;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&lt;/a&gt;) but it requires a lot of time and &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; to read it. Let me explain. The book has a very interesting story about a person who one day finds himself in a completely strange place... with his clothes soaked with seawater ... and with amnesia! But throughout the book, the margins of the pages are completely filled with comments and handwritten messages (pen, pencil, etc.). When you start reading these messages, you discover that two complete strangers (both for us, the readers, but also among themselves) began communicating casually leaving 'messages' on the margins of this book, which they borrow and return to the local library every time they want to get a response from the other. As you start reading these scribbled messages you then discover that the story described in the book may be a coded message to explain the strange life and eventual disappearance of its author. Roughly at every 10 pages you find loose notes purported to have been left by the two people who are communicating in the margins of the book, copies of documents, letters or newspapers that serve as clues and evidence that were found by them trying to unravel the mystery. For each page that you read from the book itself, you spend almost as much time reading the comments and loose papers. Super cool but a lot of work to read ;)&lt;/p&gt;

read and spent so much time with this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in January of 2014 I set out to read 30 books as part of my
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/1914-2014-reading-challenge"&gt;Reading
Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.
I wanted to focus on reading Brazilian authors early on as I felt that I
really needed to learn more about Brazilian literature and this time,
read books for fun and not because I was told to back when I was much
younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="books 1" src="http://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8561/15972365217_fa019a4c47_n.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took advantage that &lt;strong&gt;UNC&lt;/strong&gt; has a vast books collection with a very
decent section on Brazilian authors and I was able to read some really
awesome books by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3376364.Erico_Verissimo"&gt;Erico
Verissimo&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/191653.Joaquim_Manuel_de_Macedo"&gt;Joaquim Manuel de
Macedo&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/540628.Jos_de_Alencar"&gt;José de
Alencar&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/52683.Jorge_Amado"&gt;Jorge
Amado&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22458.Machado_de_Assis"&gt;Machado de
Assis&lt;/a&gt;!
I also fell in love with these authors and the fact that it took me a
couple of decades to truly appreciate them doesn't bother me at all,
since I believe that it took me this long to reach the right maturity
level... in other words, I was not ready for them yet until this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="books 2" src="http://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7536/16132335406_f5bdfa631b_n.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also fell in love with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/585.John_Steinbeck"&gt;John
Steinbeck&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1630.Ray_Bradbury"&gt;Ray
Bradbury&lt;/a&gt;,
and I think that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114322-the-grapes-of-wrath"&gt;Grapes of
Wrath&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50033.Dandelion_Wine"&gt;Dandelion
Wine&lt;/a&gt; are
two of the best books I have ever read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, 2014 was also the year I started reading short stories (to
sample different authors and see what they 'have to offer'), and I
highly recommend the short stories of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22694.Flannery_O_Connor"&gt;Flannery
O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7464.John_Cheever"&gt;John
Cheever&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/158635.Simon_Rich"&gt;Simon
Rich&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13450.Gabriel_Garc_a_M_rquez"&gt;Gabriel Garcí­a
Márquez&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="books 3" src="http://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7526/16132335446_ecd062b9bd_n.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015 I plan to continue reading more Brazilian authors and exploring
different authors and genres! I may even re-read &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33.The_Lord_of_the_Rings"&gt;The Lord of the
Rings&lt;/a&gt;
again. :)&lt;/p&gt;

career: today is my 3-year anniversary at Red Hat! Time has certainly
flown by and I really cannot believe that it has been three years since
I joined this company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it is sort of cliche to say &amp;quot;I can not believe that it has been
this long...&amp;quot; and so on and so forth, but it is so true. Back then I
joined a relatively new project with very high ambitions, and the first
few months had me swimming way out in the deepest part of the pool,
trying to learn all 'Red Hat-things' and &lt;strong&gt;Clojure&lt;/strong&gt; for the existing
automation framework (now we are fully using &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a lot of swimming for sure, and through the next months, through
many long days and weekends and hard work, tears and sweat (you know,
your typical life for a &lt;strong&gt;Quality Engineer&lt;/strong&gt; worth his/her salt), I
succeeded in adding &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; wearing many types of hats, going from a
&lt;strong&gt;Senior Quality Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;, to a &lt;strong&gt;Supervisor&lt;/strong&gt; of the team, to
eventually becoming the &lt;strong&gt;Manager&lt;/strong&gt; for a couple of teams, spread over 4
different countries. Am I bragging? Maaaybe a little bit :) but my point
is really to highlight a major key factor that made this rapid ascension
path possible: Red Hat's work philosophy and culture of rewarding those
who work hard and truly embrace the company! Sure, I worked really hard,
but I have worked just as hard before in previous places and gotten
nowhere really fast! Being recognized and rewarded for your hard work is
something new to me, and I owe a great debt of gratitude to those who
took the time to acknowledge my efforts and allowed me room to grow
within this company!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part of being a Red Hatter for 3 years? Being surrounded by an
enormous pool of talented, exciting people who not only enjoy what they
do, but are always willing to teach you something new, and/or to drop
what they're working on to lend you a helping hand! There is not a
single day that I don't learn something new, and thankfully I don't see
any sign of this trend stopping :) Have I mentioned that I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; my
teammates too? What a great bunch of guys!!! Getting up early in the
morning and walking to my home office (yeah, they let me work remotely
too) day in, day out, is never a drag because I just know that there are
new things to learn and new adventures and 'achievements to unlock'
right around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am Red Hat!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

become sort of a 'tradition' for me and because of it I have been able
to learn about many interesting books, some of which I would not have
found out on my own. I also 'blame' this activity to turning my
nightstand into a mini-library on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, while drinking my coffee this morning I realized just how much I
enjoy reading and (what I like to call) catching up with all the books I
either read when I was younger but took for granted or finally getting
to those books that have been so patiently waiting for me to get to
them. And now, whenever I'm not working or with my kids, you can bet
your bottom dollar that you'll find me somewhere outside (when the
mosquitos are not buzzing about the yard) or cozily nestled with a book
(or two) somewhere quiet around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to the point of this story, today I realized that, if I could go
back in time (which reminds me, I should probably add &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2493.The_Time_Machine?ac=1"&gt;The Time
Machine&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;
to my list) to the days when I was looking to buy a house, I would have
done two things differently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wire the entire house so that every room would have a couple of
ethernet ports;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chosen a house with a large-ish room and add wall-to-wall bookcases,
like you see in those movies where a well-off person takes their
guests into their private libraries for tea and biscuits;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that I can't change the past, and I also realize that perhaps
it is a good thing that I took my book reading for granted during my
high school and university years... I don't think I would have enjoyed
reading &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50033.Dandelion_Wine?ac=1"&gt;Dandelion
Wine&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14942.Mrs_Dalloway?from_search=true"&gt;Mrs.
Dalloway&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;
as much back then as I when I finally did. I guess reading books is very
much like the process of making good wines... with age and experience,
the reader, not the book, develops the maturity and ability to properly
savor a good story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was around 2005 when I started doing translations for Free and
Open-Source Software. Back then I was warmly welcomed to the Ubuntu
family and quickly learned all there was to know about using their
Rosetta online tool to translate and/or review existing translations for
the Brazilian Portuguese language. I spent so much time doing it, even
during working hours, that eventually I sort of &amp;quot;made a name for myself&amp;quot;
and made my way up to the upper layers of the Ubuntu Community echelon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I &amp;quot;graduated&amp;quot; and started doing translations for the upstream
projects, such as GNOME, Xfce, LXDE, and Openbox. I took on more
responsabilities, learned to use Git and make commits for myself as well
as for other contributors, and strived to unify all Brazilian Portuguese
translations across as many different projects as possible. Many
discussions were had, (literally) hundreds of hours were spent going
though also hundreds of thoundands of translations for hundreds of
different applications, none of it bringing me any monetary of financial
advantage, but all done for the simple pleasure of knowing that I was
helping make FOSS applications &amp;quot;speak&amp;quot; Brazilian Portuguese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly learned a lot though the experience of working on these many
projects... some times I made mistakes, other times I &amp;quot;fought&amp;quot; alone to
make sure that standards and procedures were complied with. All in all,
looking back I only have one regret: not being nominated to become the
leader for the Brazilian GNOME translation team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having handled 50% of the translations for one of the GNOME releases
(the other 50% was handled by a good friend, Vladimir Melo while the
leader did nothing to help) and spent much time making sure that the
release would go out the door 100% translated, I really thought I'd be
nominated to become the next leader. Not that I felt that I needed a
'title' to show off to other people, but in a way I wanted to feel that
my peers acknowledged my hard work and commitment to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing other people, even people with no previous experience, being
nominated by the current leader to replace him was a slap in the face.
It really hurt me... but I made sure to be supportive and continue to
work just as hard. I guess you could say that I lived and breathed
translations, my passion not knowing any limits or knowing when to
stop...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But stop I eventually did, several years ago, when I realized how hard
it was to land a job that would allow me to support my family (back then
I had 2 small kids) and continue to do the thing I cared the most. I
confess that I even went through a series of job interviews for the
translation role that Jono Bacon, Canonical's former community manager,
was trying to hire, but in the end things didn't work out the way I
wanted. I also flirted with another similar role at MeeGo but since they
wanted me to move to the West Coast I decided not to pursue it (I also
had fallen in love with my then current job).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pylyglot"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pylyglot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a way to keep myself somewhat still involved with the translation
communities and at the same time learn a bit more about the Django
framework, I then created &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pylyglot.org"&gt;Pylyglot&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;a web
based glossary compedium for Free and Open Source Software translators
heavily inspired on the Open-tran.eu web site... with the objective to
'provide a concise, yet comprehensive compilation of a body of
knowledge' for translators derived from existing Free and Open Source
Software translations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Pylyglot" src="/images/pylyglot.png" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been running this service on my own and paying for the cost of
domain registration and database costs out of my own pocket for a while
now, and I now find myself facing the dilema of renewing the domain
registration and keep Pylyglot alive for another year... or retire it
and end once and for all my relationship with FOSS translations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent the last couple of months thinking about it, I have now
arrived at the conclusion that it is time to let this chapter of my life
rest. Though the US$140/year that I won't be spending won't make me any
richer, I don't foresee myself either maintaining or spending any time
improving the project. So this July 21st, 2014 Pylyglot will close its
doors and cease to exist in its current form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those who knew about Pylyglot and used it and, hopefuly, found it to
be useful, my sincere thanks for using it. To those who supported my
idea and the project itself, whether by submitting code patches,
building the web site or just giving me moral support, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

and when our plane finally landed after the almost 10 1/2 hours flight
and we made our way to the luggage claim area, the reunion was filled
with a lot of hugging, laughter and a huge sigh of relief. For someone
who had spent most of their entire lives in a small and sleepy town in
the East coast of &lt;strong&gt;Brazil&lt;/strong&gt;, waking up and finding yourself at &lt;strong&gt;JFK
Airport&lt;/strong&gt; was nothing short of a major event! I had never seen so many
people of so many different races and speaking so many different
dialects in my entire life, all 16 years of them! Everywhere I looked,
everything was so different from what I was used to… even signs (so many
of them) were in a different language! Eventually we grabbed our luggage
and made our way to the parking lot looking for our car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before my sister and I left Brazil, I had the very hard task of giving
away all of my possessions and only bringing the very bare minimal to
start “a new life”. I was still going through my mid-teenager years, so
I had to give away all of my favorite music LPs, books, childhood toys,
and all the mementos I had collected through the years. This may not be
such a big deal to you, but I have always been very attached to the
things people give me, specially if they were given by someone I really
cared. Seeing the things that represented so many people and moments of
my life slowly drifting away filled me with a great feeling of personal
loss. This feeling would stay with me for the next couple of years as I
tried to adjust to my new adopted country. I was a stranger in a
different land, where nobody knew me and I did not know anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been &lt;strong&gt;23 years&lt;/strong&gt; since this event took place, and I’m still here
in the “Land of the Free”. Through the years I have survived High
School, graduated with a Bachelors in Science from an university in
Upstate New York, married (another immigrant from another country who
you shall meet soon), moved a couple of times, and now find myself
raising three young girls in &lt;strong&gt;North Carolina&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;first Maciel
generation&lt;/strong&gt; of our families to be born outside our countries! Our
similarities and differences, however, go beyond only the generation
gap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, contrary to a lot of the “stereotypical” immigrant families, we
have completely immersed ourselves into the &lt;strong&gt;Americal way of life and
culture&lt;/strong&gt;, with a dash of our childhood cultures sprinkled here and
there to add a little diversity to the mix. My wife and I stopped
observing the holidays from our countries of origin a long time ago,
specially those with no corresponding holidays here. We share a lot of
the things that we learned growing up with our kids, but always in a
nostalgic, almost didactic sort of way. We speak a mix of &lt;strong&gt;Brazilian
Portuguese-Mexican Spanish-New Jersey English&lt;/strong&gt; at home and try our best
not to force our children to learn either language in particular. As it
stands now, our kids’ primary language is English and even though I
still make a habit of speaking in Brazilian Portuguese to them, their
vocabulary consists of several words that they only say either in
Spanish or Portuguese, like the word “daddy”. My wife’s vocabulary has
also gone through a very interesting transformation, and &lt;strong&gt;she now
speaks more Portuguese than Spanish&lt;/strong&gt; when talking to our kids. Maybe it
is because she was very young when she moved to New York in the early
1990s and never really got a lot of exposure to the Spanish language
growing up in a different country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I can say is that &lt;strong&gt;I call North Carolina home&lt;/strong&gt;, I vote during
elections, I always get emotional when hearing the American Anthem, and
together with my wife I raise the next generation of the Maciel family!
Maybe they will take some of our culture and teach it to their own kids
one day… maybe one day they may even learn to speak Portuguese or
Spanish… maybe they won’t, and that is ok by me. We don’t even force
them to follow the same religion our parents (and their parents) taught
us growing up, prefering that they make that decision on their own, when
and if they’re ever interested in doing so. We want them to be able to
choose their own paths and make educated decisions about every aspect of
their lives without any pressure or guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m an &lt;strong&gt;American-Brazilian&lt;/strong&gt;, my wife is &lt;strong&gt;American-Mexican&lt;/strong&gt; and our
kids are Americans with a touch of Brazilian and Mexican pride and
culture. Together we form the &lt;strong&gt;New American Family&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short on its heels, today I'm releasing &lt;strong&gt;FauxFactory 0.2.1&lt;/strong&gt; to fix a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/B/brown-paper-bag-bug.html"&gt;brown paper bag
bug&lt;/a&gt; I
encountered last night before going to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the new &amp;quot;Lorem Ipsum&amp;quot; generator was not honoring the
&lt;strong&gt;words&lt;/strong&gt; parameter if you asked for a string longer than 70 characters.
I have fixed the issue as well as added a new test to make sure that the
generator does the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package is available on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fauxfactory/0.2.0"&gt;Pypi&lt;/a&gt; (sadly the
page is &lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt; not rendering correctly... suggestions welcome) and
can be installed via &lt;strong&gt;pip install fauxfactory&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any constructive feedback, suggestions, or file a bug report
or feature request, please use the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/omaciel/fauxfactory"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;

Ipsum&amp;quot; generator. I confess that I did not look around for any existing
implementation in python out there and just started writing code. My
idea was to create a method that would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return a &amp;quot;Lorem Ipsum&amp;quot; string if I passed no arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;fauxfactory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FauxFactory&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FauxFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;generate_iplum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return a single paragraph with a fixed number of words if I passed a
numeric &lt;strong&gt;words=x&lt;/strong&gt; argument. If &lt;strong&gt;words&lt;/strong&gt; was a large number, the text
would 'wrap around' as many times as needed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;mollit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;anim&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;est&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;laborum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if both &lt;strong&gt;words&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;paragraphs&lt;/strong&gt; are used, then a given
number of paragraphs with the specified number of words is returned,
with the text 'flowing' and 'wrapping around' as needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code python literal-block"&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FauxFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;generate_iplum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;paragraphs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

team here at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.redhat.com"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt; since last &lt;strong&gt;November,
2013&lt;/strong&gt;... and believe it or not, so far I've had absolutely zero success
in finding good, strong, with real world experience candidates in North
Carolina! I either find really smart people, who do have relevant
backgrounds or could 'hit the ground running' but are way out of my
current budget, or they lack real world experience and fall into more of
an entry level position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically I'm looking for someone who not only can 'speak python'
fluently but also has experience doing automation and writing tests, as
well as that 'QE mindset' that makes you want to automate all things and
question all things about a product! Someone who knows how to file a
good bug report and knows how to provide pertinent, relevant information
to developers so that they can fix a bug. Finally, someone who believes
in continuous integration and is excited about an opportunity to improve
and augment our existing testing
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/omaciel/robottelo"&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt; and work with a
very exciting product, knowing that your contributions will affect
literally thousands of customers world wide!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus points if you know what &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/"&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt;
is and have played with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.lag.net/paramiko/"&gt;Paramiko&lt;/a&gt;
and/or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/"&gt;Requests&lt;/a&gt;!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does that interest you? Feel that you got what I'm looking for? Then
take a peek at these two positions and apply fast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; This is more of a note for myself than a proper
tutorial or howto, so I make no promises that this will work for you.
The setup used through this post was a Mac OS laptop upgraded to the
very latest version of the OS.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started doing &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt; development using &lt;strong&gt;Emacs&lt;/strong&gt;, I
have unsuccessfully tried to configure
&lt;strong&gt;`Rope &amp;lt;http://rope.sourceforge.net/&amp;gt;`__,&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;a python refactoring
library&amp;quot;…&amp;nbsp;until last Friday. Turns out I wasn’t too far off the mark
during the many iterations I went through to get it done, but the
following post was tremendously helpful to
me:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2010/05/my-emacs-python-environment/"&gt;http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2010/05/my-emacs-python-environment/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what worked for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;strong&gt;Pymacs&lt;/strong&gt; (Emacs part):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pinard/Pymacs/tarball/v0.2"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; latest
(0.25 as of the writing of this post)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cd to the source code directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mkdir ~/.emacs.d/vendor/pymacs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cp pymacs.el&amp;nbsp;~/.emacs.d/vendor/pymacs/pymacs.el&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pinard/Pymacs/tarball/v0.25"&gt;emacs -batch -eval ‘(byte-compile-file
“~/.emacs.d/vendor/pymacs/pymacs.el”)’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pinard/Pymacs/tarball/v0.25"&gt;Install Pymacs
(&lt;/a&gt;Python part):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sudo pip install
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pinard/Pymacs/tarball/v0.2"&gt;https://github.com/pinard/Pymacs/tarball/v0.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ropemacs&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;strong&gt;rope&lt;/strong&gt; with&amp;nbsp;sudo pip install
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bitbucket.org/agr/ropemacs/get/tip.tar.gz"&gt;http://bitbucket.org/agr/ropemacs/get/tip.tar.gz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now configure Emacs by adding the following lines to your init.el file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;(require ‘pymacs)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;(pymacs-load “ropemacs” “rope-“)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;(setq ropemacs-enable-autoimport t)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, start up Emacs and make sure to read this
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/agr/ropemacs"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; for some examples on
how to use Rope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually like to use python to script my day to day tests against
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.katello.org/"&gt;Katello&lt;/a&gt; (you may have seen some of my
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ogmaciel.tumblr.com/post/52170839167/populating-a-katello-instance-using-the-cli"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ogmaciel.tumblr.com/post/29571582261/script-to-populate-a-katello-instance-with-valid-data"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;
about using the Katello CLI for the same purpose) and I figured I’d
start showing some basic examples for anyone else out there who may be
interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have already installed and configured your Katello instance
(learn how to do this
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fedorahosted.org/katello/wiki/Install"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) with the
default configurations, we now have a few options to proceed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write and run your scripts in the same environment as your server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/katello-cli/"&gt;katello-cli&lt;/a&gt; package
(&lt;em&gt;pip install katello-cli&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use git to clone the katello-cli
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Katello/katello-cli"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;git
clone&amp;nbsp;https://github.com/Katello/katello-cli.git&lt;/em&gt;) and make sure to
include it into your &lt;strong&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1&lt;/strong&gt; is by far the easiest approach since you should have all
the dependencies (namely &lt;strong&gt;kerberos&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;M2Crypto&lt;/strong&gt;) already
installed, but I like &lt;strong&gt;Option 3&lt;/strong&gt; as it allows me to always have the
latest code to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re ready to write some code! The first thing we’ll do is import
some of the Katello modules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
from katello.client import server
from katello.client.server import BasicAuthentication
from katello.client.api.organization import OrganizationAPI
from katello.client.api.system_group import SystemGroupAPI&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we establish a connection to the Katello server
(&lt;strong&gt;qetello01.example.com&lt;/strong&gt; in my case), using the default credentials of
&lt;strong&gt;admin&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;admin&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
katello_server = server.KatelloServer(host='qetello01.example.com',
path_prefix='/katello/', port=443)
katello_server.set_auth_method(BasicAuthentication(username='admin',
password='admin'))
server.set_active_server(katello_server)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s now instantiate the Organization API object and use it to fetch
the “&lt;strong&gt;ACME_Corporation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; that gets automatically created for a
default installation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;organization_api = OrganizationAPI()&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;org = organization_api.organization('ACME_Corporation')
print&amp;nbsp;org
{u’apply_info_task_id’: None,
u’created_at’: u’2013-09-12T20:15:06Z’,
u’default_info’: {u’distributor’: [], u’system’: []},
u’deletion_task_id’: None,
u’description’: u’ACME_Corporation Organization’,
u’id’: 1,
u’label’: u’ACME_Corporation’,
u’name’: u’ACME_Corporation’,
u’owner_auto_attach_all_systems_task_id’: None,
u’service_level’: None,
u’service_levels’: [],
u’updated_at’: u’2013-09-12T20:15:06Z’}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, let’s create a brand new organization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
new_org = organization_api.create(name='New Org', label='new-org',
description='Created via API')
print new_org
{u’apply_info_task_id’: None,
u’created_at’: u’2013-09-12T21:48:55Z’,
u’default_info’: {u’distributor’: [], u’system’: []},
u’deletion_task_id’: None,
u’description’: u’Created via API’,
u’id’: 283,
u’label’: u’new-org’,
u’name’: u’New Org’,
u’owner_auto_attach_all_systems_task_id’: None,
u’service_level’: None,
u’service_levels’: [],
u’updated_at’: u’2013-09-12T21:48:55Z’}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it is pretty straight forward to use python to create
some useful scripts to drive a Katello server, whether you want to
populate it with a pre-defined set of data (e.g. default users, roles,
permissions, organizations, content, etc) or to test core functionality
as I do with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/omaciel/mangonel"&gt;Mangonel&lt;/a&gt;, my pet
project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/71c0527841d30b80424b"&gt;Gist&lt;/a&gt; of the
code mentioned in this post, and let me know if this was useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Em 2008, depois de algumas discussões sobre o tipo de conteúdo que meu
blog estava gerando em alguns agregadores nacionais, eu tomei a decisāo
de criar meu próprio agregador com o seguinte objetivo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;O&amp;nbsp;**Planeta GNU/Linux*&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;nasceu da minha necessidade de querer ler
blogs de pessoas relacionadas ao movimento Brasileiro de software livre,
mas sem a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;censura bitolada&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;que outros agregadores de blogs usam
para filtrar o conteúdo que é publicado.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;O critério para entrar no Planeta é super simples:&amp;nbsp;**eu tenho de
gostar do material*&lt;/em&gt;! Ao contrário dos outros agregadores que geralmente
são vinculados a comunidades ou distribuições, este site aqui é
completamente independente e sem censura nenhuma!*”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desde entāo eu venho administrando o conteúdo e tentando adicionar
material que seja relevante aos meus interesses e daqueles que também
acompanham este “planeta”. Mas nos últimos 2 anos tanto o meu tempo como
meu interesse por este tipo de fonte de notícias diminuiu bastante e o
projeto ficou meio que jogado às traças… até a semana passada quando
recebi um e-mail me avisando que estava na hora de renovar o meu
domínio. Foi aí que eu resolvi que nāo fazia mais sentido em manter um
projeto que eu nāo tenho mais interesse, e em outubro deste ano o
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://planeta.gnulinuxbrasil.org/"&gt;Planeta GNU/Linux Brasil&lt;/a&gt;
deixará de existir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agradeço a todos que apoiaram o projeto por tanto tempo e até a próxima
:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depois de vários meses sem “fora do ar”, tenho o grande prazer em trazer
mais um episódio sobre o projeto&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;GNOME&lt;/strong&gt;! Desta vez convidei
o&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Enrico Nicoletto&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;e&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Rafael Ferreira&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;para conversar sobre o
processo de traduçōes, que mais uma vez promete entregar mais uma versão
completamente traduzida para o nosso bom português!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A entrevista aconteceu “na estrada” quando eu estava voltando de viagem,
e acabei gravando o episódio de um hotel lá em Richmond no estado da
Virgínia. Mesmo com alguns problemas iniciais (teve uma hora que minha
conexão caiu, mas eu consegui voltar logo), eu consegui bater um papo
super legal com o Enrico e Rafael sobre como todo o processo de
traduçōes, desde como eles entraram para a equipe oficial, até como
chegaram a ser os administradores da equipe brasileira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O episódio todo ficou com um pouco mais de 30 minutos, mas para quem
quizer assistir o&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/136X3jF"&gt;vídeo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;vocês poderão
escutar sobre outros temas que acabaram ficando de fora na hora da
ediçã0 (devido ao tamanho final do podcast), como seus planos para o
futuro da equipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/13jSmSx"&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; to automatically populate a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.katello.org/"&gt;Katello&lt;/a&gt; server instance with real data (hi
&lt;strong&gt;reyc&lt;/strong&gt;!) I wrote that a while back and though it still does contain
some helpful commands, I figured it was about time I updated it. Well,
it took me longer than I expected to find some time and clean it up, but
I think I can now show you a brand new script which also includes the
extra feature of downloading a manifest file directly from &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt;'s
portal and importing it as part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the script assumes that you have the following information
(either as environmental variables or substituted into the script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RHN_USERNAME&lt;/strong&gt;: A valid username for
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://access.redhat.com/"&gt;https://access.redhat.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RHN_PASSWORD&lt;/strong&gt;: A valid password for
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://access.redhat.com/"&gt;https://access.redhat.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISTRIBUTOR&lt;/strong&gt;: An existing distributor UUID with access to Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6 Server products&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/15Fk4di"&gt;new script&lt;/a&gt; is know to work with the very
&lt;strong&gt;latest Katello nightly build&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have any suggestions or
constructive feedback, feel free to leave me a comment here or fork the

and occasional grey hairs) some interesting changes on how I manage and
maintain my “digital belongings”. For a long while I used to worry about
backing up and storing in a safe place all the files, photos, books,
movies and music I’ve collected through the years. I have also managed
to collect a variety of different external USB hard drives to keep up
with this digital sprawl, where for each iteration the next device would
increase in size and sometimes in speed compared to the current one. It
got to a point where I got tired of the backup/restore game and found
myself paying less and less attention to the things I had spent so much
time maintaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music was one of the last items that I eventually stopped backing up.
One day last year I took my entire collection of approximately 9000
(legal) songs and uploaded them to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/"&gt;Google
Play&lt;/a&gt;! The very next time I re-installed my
desktop I didn’t have to restore my music collection anymore. All I
needed was a net connection and I was off to listening to my tunes! I
also had full access to that collection via my Android phone and laptop!
Triple yummy! Sure, without net access I would be out of luck, but I
could always keep a smaller subset of my collection around if I wanted
to listen to anything while offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while I noticed that I seldon played my own tunes, often
spending more and more of my music listening minutes on sites such as
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pandora.com/"&gt;Pandora&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://grooveshark.com/"&gt;Grooveshark&lt;/a&gt; to experience new types of
music and genres. At one point I found myself subscribing to Pandora,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rdio.com/"&gt;Rdio&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.spotify.com/"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, looking for what in my opinion
would provide me with the best listening experience. After about a month
I think I have finally found the combination that gets me closer to that
goal: &lt;strong&gt;Pandora&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;Spotify&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little background though. I have been a Pandora (non-paying) customer
for many years now and I can’t say enough about the music quality and
the variety that you can get for this service! I mean, for the
completely FREE option (with the occasional advertisement) you get to
listen to (what feels like to be) hand picked songs that match whatever
criteria you can come up with! Be it a song, a word, an artist or an
album, Pandora’s matching algorithm is by far the best I’ve seen out
there. Period! It is because of this plus the fact that I can access it
from anywhere and any device with net access that I became a paid
customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how about those times when I specifically want to listen to a given
song or album or even make a playlist with some of my favorite jams?
After a while I learned a nice
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mashable.com/2013/04/09/pandora-tips-tricks/"&gt;trick&lt;/a&gt; that
lets you sample an album from Pandora but that wasn’t enough for what I
wanted to do. So Grooveshark was definitely a great find for me and for
a while I really enjoyed the freedom and wide selection that it offered
me for free. Something really simple but it also made a difference for
me was that I could “scrobble” the music I listened to my
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.last.fm/user/OgMaciel"&gt;Last.fm&lt;/a&gt; account, something that
Pandora doesn’t do. But alas, I couldn’t listen to my playlists on the
go or even using my phone, so I started looking for options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Rdio impressed me right away for being exactly what Groveshark was
but with the added capability of being available on multiple platforms,
and including some of the newest and latest releases! The pricing model
was a bit more expensive than Pandora, but it did give me the ability to
create my own playlists and interact with my friends via different
social networks. I definitely enjoyed the experience and would have
stuck with if it wasn’t for the small music collection that is available
right now. I understand that Rdio tries to add as many new (and old)
titles as it can, but at the end of the day, I couldn’t always find what
I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify was the “dark horse” during my experimentation, mostly because
it didn’t offer a first class client for Linux. There was a “half baked”
client out there that never worked for me/or crashed too many times… I
even ran the Windows client via Wine for the first 2-3 weeks but it felt
“dirty” to pay for a service that would not run natively or provide a
decent support for my platform. The Android and iOS apps worked like a
charm, but I spent the bulk of my days in front of a Fedora box and
listening to music from my phone was not going to cut it for me. The
music variety is definitely much larger that what Rdio offers and it
even has its own “Radio” streaming that provides something similar to
what Pandora does. But the matching algorithm is still light-years
behind Pandora and I often found myself wondering how certain songs and
genres ended up in the “station” I was listening to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about a month into the experiment, it looked like I was going to
keep Pandora and Rdio to get great music selection and variety
(Pandora), web front end access and multi-platform support (Pandora,
Rdio), and playlists (Rdio)… until a co-worker mentioned that Spotify
had just announced their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.spotify.com/home"&gt;web based
player&lt;/a&gt;! All of a sudden Spotify went
from being in last place to bumping Rdio out of the equation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Spotify web player" src="http://bit.ly/14NtWo9" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I am using both Pandora and Spotify at home and on the go
(Spotify lets you download your playlists for offline listening) and so
far the experience has definitely been positive. I feel that the
streaming quality and variety has provided me with many enjoyable hours
of music while I work and even my kids have started experimenting with
Pandora as they get more exposure to the musical world. And if I ever
feel like listening to some of my own music, some of which is not yet
found on Spotify, I can always turn to Google Play… and I definitely
enjoy not having to manage my backups anymore. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had one of those “once in a a lifetime” opportunities,
thanks to my wife who dragged me to a presentation hosted by the
University of North Carolina. The presentation by Dr. Eduardo Torres
Cuevas, titled “Preserving Cuba’s Cultural Heritage in the 21st Century”
attracted a small gathering, apparently&amp;nbsp;mostly&amp;nbsp;made up of UNC staff and
students who are currently enrolled in one of their languages courses. I
wasn’t really sure what to expect from it, but being the supportive
husband that I am, I signed off from work a bit earlier and together
with our 2 kids we drove to the main campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire lecture was done in Spanish while a translator tried her best
to keep up with Dr. Cuevas’ detailed and humored style of prose, as he
told us about the history behind Cuba’s National Library. I must tell
you, being a “real time” translator is not an easy task, and though Dr.
Cuevas tried to slow things down so she could do her job in a timely
fashion, she still had to&amp;nbsp;summarize&amp;nbsp;a lot of what was being said in
order to keep up with him. Sadly, a lot of the “good stuff” was never
mentioned and/or was completely lost in translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cuevas was an excellent speaker and was able to quickly put everyone
at ease right away and transport us to the Havana of the 1950s. The
entire lecture lasted approximately 50 minutes but in reality it felt
more like a small fraction of that! I could tell that he is extremely
passionate about preserving the Cuban cultural heritage for posterity,
and together with a strong character and charisma, I dare say that
everyone in attendance was completely captivated by his stories as if in
a trance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let me remind you of one minor detail I mentioned early on that you
may have overlooked: everything was in Spanish, a language which though
not completely unfamiliar to me, is not my first or second language in
order of fluency (Brazilian Portuguese and English in this order if
you’re wondering what my first and second languages are). Sure, there
was a translator, but after the first 3 minutes I completely ignored her
voice and focused completely on Dr. Cuevas. Eventually, the translator’s
voice became white noise or just an annoyance, as we would have to stop
the flow of the lecture in order for her to turn beautiful story
telling-style prose to a short. almost. dry. list. of. facts. and.
numbers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel extremely lucky that I was able to not only meet but hear someone
who may be a very important person in the history of Cuba. I also feel
extremely lucky that I was able to follow and understand the entire
presentation in the “original format” without the need for “caption” or
any other aid. Had I relied solely on translations, I would have never
really gotten all the little jokes, nuances and true meaning behind the
words uttered by the gentleman from Havana… and most likely would not
feel this great urge I now feel to make Cuba, and specially the National
Library of Cuba, my choice for the next time I go anywhere outside the
States for vacation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eu conheci o&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Everaldo&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;em uma tarde super calorenta durante a
abertura do evento&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;GUADEC&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;nas&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Ilhas Canárias&lt;/strong&gt;. O mais
interessante foi que não demorou mais que um dia para que nossa amizade
se tornasse igual aquelas amizades que fazemos quando criança… aquelas
pessoas que não importa o tempo ou a distância, você sempre fica feliz
de encontrar e bater um papo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O Everaldo teve uma das oportunidades que eu sempre sonhei em ter:
trabalhar lado a lado com o&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Miguel de Icaza&lt;/strong&gt;, um dos fundadores
do&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Projeto GNOME&lt;/strong&gt;, figura quase que mitológica do mundo do software
livre e hoje empresário com várias companhias de sucesso em seu
histórico! Ele também trabalhava com a tecnologia .NET numa época quando
qualquer coisa que fosse remotamente relacianada à Microsoft era motivo
para perseguição e “trollage” pelos apoiadores mais zelosos do Linux.
Durante grande parte de nosso bate-papo, conversamos sobre como que ele
foi parar na&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Novell&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;trabalhando para a equipe do Miguel, como era
o dia-a-dia lidando com o sentimento anti-&amp;nbsp;Microsoft, quais tecnologias
ele recomenda para quem está começando a trabalhar na área de TI, o
“problema” do&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Java&lt;/strong&gt;, e sobre seu mais novo projeto,&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/tocadocanuto?feature=g-subs-u"&gt;Toca do
Canuto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

conversamos sobre o que ele faz na Yahoo, em quais projetos que
trabalha, e acabei descobrindo que ele é mais um exemplo de uma pessoa
que teve seu trabalho perante uma comunidade de software livre
reconhecido, levando-o a ser indicado para trabalhar em uma companhia de

Mayer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;fez, declatando
que não se poderá mais trabalhar remotamente na Yahoo, sobre o efeito

&lt;p&gt;Passados &lt;strong&gt;51 episódios&lt;/strong&gt;, neste último sábado o &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/"&gt;Castálio
Podcast&lt;/a&gt; completou &lt;strong&gt;2 anos&lt;/strong&gt;! Foram
muitas entrevistas super divertidas, animadas e prá lá de &amp;nbsp;interessantes
com pessoas representando vários projetos e áreas de trabalho! Para
comemorar, decidi atender aos pedidos de alguns ouvintes e fazer mais
uma entrevista… comigo mesmo! A &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/12YS1pU"&gt;primeira vez&lt;/a&gt;
foi quando ainda não havia um formato definido e, para falar a verdade,
eu não pesava que ia conseguir levar o projeto para frente por tanto
tempo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Então eu pedi ao meu amigo &lt;strong&gt;KurtKraut&lt;/strong&gt; (que também já foi
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/VAfGLG"&gt;entrevistado&lt;/a&gt;) para fazer as perguntas sobre
os tópicos que não foram abordados na primeira vez, como sobre a origem
do meu nome, como que vim parar nos Estados Unidos, sobre minha carreira
na &lt;strong&gt;rPath&lt;/strong&gt; e &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt;, dentre outras coisas que somente um amigo de
muitos anos saberia perguntar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Espero que vocês gostem deste episódio, e espero poder celebrar com
vocês mais um ano de entrevistas e bate-papo!&lt;/p&gt;

coisas da linguagem python quando me deparei com uma apresentação
do&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Luciano Ramalho&lt;/strong&gt;, o entrevistado deste episódio deste episódio. O
que me chamou atenção não foi nem tanto a qualidade do material ou a
didática do mesmo, mas sim o fato do autor ser brasileiro E por ter
feito tudo em inglês. Claro que, se você vive no Brasil e trabalha ou
convive com quem trabalha com python, o nome do Luciano não lhe deve ser
estranho. Mas para mim, que moro há 21 anos no exterior, foi uma
descoberta super maneira!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quanto mais eu pesquisei sobre ele, mais animado eu ficava em conhecer
“a pessoa por trás dos slides” das apresentações “&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://speakerdeck.com/ramalho/python-encapsulation-with-descriptors"&gt;Python:
Encapsulation with
Descriptors&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;e
&amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://speakerdeck.com/ramalho/iterators-and-generators-the-python-way"&gt;Iterators &amp;amp; generators: the Python
Way&lt;/a&gt;”.
Mais gostoso ainda foi descobrir que estas&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;apresentações são
inéditas&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;no público brasileiro e serão apresentadas
na&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/"&gt;PyCon&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;americana este ano!&amp;nbsp;Durante
nosso bate-papo, o Luciano me contou como que foi a criação
da&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://associacao.python.org.br"&gt;Associação Python Brasil&lt;/a&gt;,
quais foram seus primeiros objetivos e como foi o seu primeiro mandato
como presidente da mesma. Também discutimos sobre os vários frameworks
que existem para quem quer ser programador web com python, alguns fatos
interessantes sobre o&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Zope&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Plone&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Flask&lt;/strong&gt;,
e&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Web2Py&lt;/strong&gt;, e quais delas ele recomenda para quem está iniciando no
mundo de programação.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para quem estiver interessado a aprender a programar, o Luciano também
oferece cursos online na&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://turing.com.br/wiki/index.php?title=Oficinas_Turing"&gt;Oficinas
Turing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;para
iniciantes e programadores com mais experiência, como “&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://turing.com.br/wiki/index.php?title=Objetos_Pythonicos"&gt;Objetos
Pythonicos&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;
e &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://turing.com.br/wiki/index.php?title=Python_para_quem_sabe_Python"&gt;Python para quem sabe
Python&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por último falamos sobre o&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Garoa_Hacker_Clube"&gt;Garoa Hacker
Clube&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/GaroaHC/photos_stream"&gt;fotos&lt;/a&gt;),
um&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;HackerSpace&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;que ele criou em São Paulo com uma proposta bem
interessante: um espaço onde você pode ir para conhecer gente
interessante e aprender a programar, usar tecnologias recentes
como&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Arduino&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;e&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Rasberry Pi&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;usando a metodologia “mão na
massa”, e para quem virar sócio, sua própria chave para usar o
espaço/laboratório qualquer hora do dia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para o primeiro episódio de 2013 eu tive o prazer de entrevistar
o&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Fabiano Fidêncio&lt;/strong&gt;, recém contratado pela&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt;! Durante
nosso bate-papo o Fabiano conta como que ele aprendeu a programar “de
verdade” na&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.profusion.mobi/"&gt;ProFUSION&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;e como que&amp;nbsp;de
usuário&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;GNOME&lt;/strong&gt;, ele se transformou em desenvolvedor quando começou
a trabalhar no&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://live.gnome.org/Boxes"&gt;GNOME
Boxes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;e&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libosinfo"&gt;libosinfo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;pelo&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Google
Summer of Code&lt;/strong&gt;. Sua participação neste projeto foi muito interessante,
já que ele teve de aproveitar um código base escrito por uma pessoa da
Red Hat e refatorar para que ficasse mais limpo e genérico, algo que não
é super fácil de fazer. O projeto acabou virando mais que um hobby, e
devido ao seu trabalho o Fabiano acabou sendo contratado para trabalhar
na Red Hat a partir de março! Não vou revelar qual o projeto que ele vai
trabalhar (você vai ter de escutar o episódio), mas além de trabalho
novo, ele também vai se mudar do Brasil para uma cidade européia, onde
cerveja é mais barato que água!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woke up to the following email this morning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Og Maciel,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations on your one-year anniversary with Red Hat! Thank
you for your commitment and work over the past year. We hope that it
has been everything you expected it to be and look forward to
celebrating your future success with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time sure flies when you’re having too much fun! I can’t believe it’s
been one whole year since I joined &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.redhat.com/"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;
as a &lt;strong&gt;Senior QA Engineer&lt;/strong&gt; to work on their
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.redhat.com/products/cloud-computing/cloudforms/"&gt;CloudForms&lt;/a&gt;
project! So much has happened since then that it is a bit hard to
remember all the new and exciting things I had the pleasure of being a
part of! It is absolutely grate to be able to work on such a cool and
challenging environment, and to experience first hand what open source
and meritocracy really means!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember being asked during my interview process what my long-term
goals were (or something along these lines), and my answer was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;In the next 5 years I want to be the &lt;strong&gt;Go To&lt;/strong&gt; person to all
questions related to &lt;strong&gt;CloudForms&lt;/strong&gt;!”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, one year down and four more to go! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demorou mais chegou!!! Devido a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/aviso-aos-navegantes/"&gt;problemas
pessoais&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;eu
infelizmente fiquei um pouco sem tempo para agendar as minhas
entrevistas, mas te garanto que foi super difícil para mim deixar de
publicar a cada 2 semanas. Mas nada como um pouco de tempo para colocar
a vida de novo nos trilhos, e eu quero agradecer a todos que me enviaram
mensagems de apoio aqui, por e-mail e pelas várias redes sociais que
uso!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Então, para celebrar a nossa volta, quero dedicar este episódio
ao&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/VfgrTE"&gt;André Gondim&lt;/a&gt;, que há um ano atrás nos
deixou de uma forma tão súbita! O André foi parte da vida de muitas
pessoas, e na minha opinião, a “cara” do Ubuntu no Brasil!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O convidado deste episódio é o&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.julianfernandes.com/"&gt;Julian
Fernandes&lt;/a&gt;, um dos criadores e
mantenedores do&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ubuntubrsc.com/"&gt;Ubuntu BR SC&lt;/a&gt;, um dos
sites mais visitados pelos usuários de Linux (e não só usuários do
Ubuntu Linux, diz o Julian) brasileiros buscando notícias ou tutoriais
para dar uma “perfumada” em seus sistemas ou configurar algum
dispositivo ou serviço! Com uma média de 8 a 10 mil visitantes por dia,
o Ubuntu BR SC conta com uma equipe super dinâmica que está sempre
adicionando conteúdo ou respondendo os comentários e perguntas de seus
visitantes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durante nosso bate-papo conversamos sobre como que o site&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu BR
SC&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;nasceu, quais as ferramentas e tecnologias que são usadas, quem são
os integrantes da equipe responsável pela geração e seleção de artigos,
e quais os planos para 2013 (dica: grandes surpresas por vir em
janeiro!!!). Também falamos sobre seu gosto por música (depois cheque
o&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/JuHitoriX"&gt;canal&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;que ele tem
no&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Youtube&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;com algumas de suas apresentações, incluindo ele
tocando&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wv0K9S7xbA&amp;amp;list=UUVwPM6qoLRlRJJbucSOXzug&amp;amp;index=4&amp;amp;feature=plcp"&gt;Knocking on Heavens
Door&lt;/a&gt;),
o fato dele ter parado a universidade para trabalhar no site, seu Top 5,
e como que vocês podem ajudar a manter o site no ar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to follow up on my previous
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ogmaciel.tumblr.com/post/36760809108/extending-the-default-ec2-root-partition-for-an"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;
in regards to how to resize the root partition of an EC2 instance. Turns
out that, once you’ve edited the root partition while in the launch
panel, you can then perform the resize command right away, as soon as
the instance is up and running and you have ssh’ed to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:root&amp;#64;ip-aa-bb-cc-dd"&gt;root&amp;#64;ip-aa-bb-cc-dd&lt;/a&gt; ~]# resize2fs /dev/xvde1&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely better than what I thought one had to do to get a
bigger root partition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I was playing with &lt;strong&gt;EC2&lt;/strong&gt;, trying to launch a &lt;strong&gt;RHEL 6.3&lt;/strong&gt;
instance so that I could then install the latest version of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://katello.org"&gt;Katello&lt;/a&gt; and beat a bit on it… just for fun, you
know? Using the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2"&gt;EC2 Management
Console&lt;/a&gt; web interface I used the
“classical” wizard to select all the components I wanted for a
&lt;strong&gt;m1.large&lt;/strong&gt; instance, making sure to edit the default &lt;strong&gt;7.5&amp;nbsp;GB&lt;/strong&gt; root
partition they give you so that I could have more space available to
synchronize content… but when the instance finally came up I realized
that my disk space was still showing the default value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:root&amp;#64;ip-aa-bb-cc-dd"&gt;root&amp;#64;ip-aa-bb-cc-dd&lt;/a&gt; ~]# df -h&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filesystem &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Size &amp;nbsp;Used Avail Use% Mounted on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/dev/xvde1 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;5.7G &amp;nbsp;1.7G &amp;nbsp;4.0G &amp;nbsp;30% /&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;none &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;3.7G &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 0 &amp;nbsp;3.7G &amp;nbsp; 0% /dev/shm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrecked my brain about that for quite some time, retracing my steps
and even terminating my instance and starting from scratch a few times,
thinking that perhaps I had missed an obvious step. Eventually I came
across a few posts online and was able to solve my problem, which I will
try to describe below. Obviously, feel free to read the original posts
for more information. The steps are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once your instance is up and running, stop it selecting the Stop
option from the Management Console window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, switch to the Elastic Block Store section and select your
instance’s volume from the &amp;nbsp;Volumes subsection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detach the selected volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the option to create a snapshot off of the detached volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch to the Snapshot subsection and select the newly created
snapshot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the Create Volume option and create a larger volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to the Volumes subsction, select the newly create volume and
attach it as the root volume for your instance (should be /dev/sda1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart your instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as the instance is back online, ssh to it and verify that the
disk size has not changed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, resize the root partition so that it can “absorb” the larger volume
we created:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:root&amp;#64;ip-aa-bb-cc-dd"&gt;root&amp;#64;ip-aa-bb-cc-dd&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;~]# resize2fs /dev/xvde1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;resize2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filesystem at /dev/xvde1 is mounted on /; on-line resizing required&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;old desc_blocks = 1, new_desc_blocks = 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing an on-line resize of /dev/xvde1 to 20971520 (4k) blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filesystem on /dev/xvde1 is now 20971520 blocks long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything goes well you should now see a much larger disk available
(a 80GB volume in my case):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:root&amp;#64;ip-aa-bb-cc-dd"&gt;root&amp;#64;ip-aa-bb-cc-dd&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;~]# df -h&lt;/p&gt;

unfortunate event. About 10 weeks ago my wife and I learned that she was
pregnant, something that we both wanted very much since our last child
was born in 2007. So for the last 10 weeks we have been taking all the
necessary steps to prepare our daughters, our house and our work
schedules to welcome another child into our family. We also decided that
we would break the news very slowly at first, making sure to share the
news with immediate family and close friends and planning to tell
everyone else after we had our first ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That first ultrasound happened this last Friday, and for the first time
we also had the kids with us in the room so they would be the first ones
to hear their baby sister/brother’s heart beat… but we didn’t. After 5
minutes of&amp;nbsp;unsuccessful&amp;nbsp;attempts to grab the slightest sound or sign of
a heart beat or even the faintest sign of movement, our doctor
recommended that we try the ultrasound at the local hospital, as they
had a more advanced machine and would be able to give us a more concrete
diagnostic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we spent Saturday and Sunday agonizing over what would happen Monday
morning when we were scheduled for the next session… and tried our best
to have as much of a normal life one can have, trying to shield our
children from the anxiety and 1000 horrible thoughts that kept creeping
through our heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we managed to get someone to watch over our kids and headed
early to UNC Hospital for what we expected would be a life changing
moment. I guess I could write about how we, my wife and I, agonized
every single second until we were finally taken into the ultrasound
room. How we held our breath waiting as the person operating the machine
performed some routine checks and measurements, before she finally
switched to the test we cared the most… and how heart breaking (how
ironic) it was to hear only the silence coming off the heart monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say we are very much heart broken and still trying to digest
what just happened to us. I believe I am coping a bit better than my
wife, but this feeling that I have things under control comes and goes
in waves. She keeps going over and over what she could possibly have
done differently, or what she may have done to endanger the life of our
unborn child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late afternoon yesterday I broke the news to our oldest daughter, and
after the initial shock she seems to have taken the news as well as a
child is expected to take. She has been very supportive and is always
telling her mom how much she loves her. However, I haven’t told our
youngest one yet… She’s been looking forward to sharing her room with a
new sibling and I don’t feel that we’re ready to tell her yet… but that
day will most likely be some time this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my wife had what the doctor called a “missed miscarriage”, the
10-week-old baby is still inside her and we now have to decide how to
proceed with the removal and disposal of what once was a living human
being. Tough decision to make, I assure you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our immediate family has been aware of the situation and has been
extremely supportive, even though they’re spread across NY and NJ. Our
pain is still very much fresh and we’re still debating what the next
step will be. With Halloween literally around the corner, we will also
have to make sure our kids are not affected by that next step, whatever
it may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to share a bit of our most intimate news with you all who
follow me and my friends who near or far are very important to us…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olá pessoal e sejam muito bem vindos ao primeiro episódio de outubro!
Desta vez eu tive a oportunidade de conversar pelo&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Google
Hangout&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;com o&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Carlos Brando&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;e&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Rafael Rosa
Fu&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;do&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://grokpodcast.com/"&gt;**GrokPodcast**&lt;/a&gt;! Foi super
divertido conversar com eles, e o bate-papo foi tão bom que eu decidi
dividir a entrevista em duas partes para ficar mais conveninente para
vocês escutarem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nesta primeira parte conversamos sobre como que a idéia de criar o
podcast surgiu em um barzinho em São Paulo, quando o Brando e Rafael
conversavam com o&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Fábio Akita&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;depois de um&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;RubyConf&lt;/strong&gt;. Logo
depois do primeiro episódio eles resolveram mudar um pouco o foco (que
tinha começado falando sobre livros) e desde então os tópicos e
entrevistados ficaram mais e mais interessantes. Já são&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;mais de 77
episódios&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;nos ensinando a “grokar” mais sobre vários temas e o futuro
promete novas aventuras!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Então gostaria de convidá-los a conhecerem um pouco mais sobre o Carlos
Brando que dentre várias coisas escreveu alguns livros sobre Ruby on
Rails, trabalhou em companhias como a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Portugal Telecom
Group&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;AT&amp;amp;T Latin
America&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;DirecTV&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;SKY&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;VISA&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Surgeworks&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Amanaiê&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;e&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Sociably&lt;/strong&gt;,
e hoje prefere uma vida mais pacata em Franca, SP. Também temos o Rafael
Rosa Fu que mora em Montreal no Canadá, tem 5 gatos (Cecília, Dalila,
Ariela, Juju e Bebê), e hoje trabalha no&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;iWeb&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nesta última quinta-feira tive o prazer em entrevistar o&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Licio
Fonseca&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;da&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;! Eu e o Licio nos conhecemos nos saudosos tempos
do&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu Brasil&lt;/strong&gt;, mas não conversávamos desde 2006 se não me
engano. Desde então muita coisa aconteceu, e hoje ele trabalha na
Google, fazendo toda a manutenção e administração da infra estrutura de
toda a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;América do Sul&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durante nosso bate-papo, conversamos sobre o que ele faz por lá, sobre o
seu dia a dia, como que conseguiu este trabalho, e sobre o processo de
entrevistas e seleção para trabalhar na Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Também conversamos sobre as modificações que aconteceram na companhia
desde que ele comçou a trabalhar, as viagens que ele fez à trabalho,
rumores, sua&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;época de skatista&lt;/strong&gt;, vida de casado e coleção de action
figures! E para quem acompanhou a gravação ao vivo pelo&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Youtube&lt;/strong&gt;,
teve até o Licio dançando a música&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0"&gt;Gangnam

&lt;p&gt;Na semana passada eu tive o grande prazer e honra de participar do
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ubuntero.com.br/"&gt;Opencast&lt;/a&gt; em um
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ubuntero.com.br/2012/08/opencast-16-distribuicoes-linux/"&gt;episódio&lt;/a&gt;
onde discutimos várias coisas relacionadas à distribuições Linux! Por
coincidência, meu amigo &lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Melo&lt;/strong&gt; tinha me recomendando
entrevistar uma pessoa que por muito tempo tinha criado e mantido uma
distribuição nacional, e recentemente decidiu parar o projeto!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neste último episódio então tive o grande prazer de conversar com o
&lt;strong&gt;Bruno Gonçalves&lt;/strong&gt;, criador e mantenedor do
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.biglinux.com.br/web/"&gt;BigLinux&lt;/a&gt;! Até este nosso bate-papo
eu confesso que não conhecia este projeto, o que é realmente uma pena. O
BigLinux nasceu de uma “remasterização” do &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.hardware.com.br/kurumin/"&gt;Kurumin
Linux&lt;/a&gt; e em pouquíssimo tempo
fez bastante barulho ao adicionar vários recursos super avançados para a
sua época! O número de recursos e tecnologias utilizados pelo Bruno é
realmente impressionante e quando terminamos nossa entrevista eu fiquei
literalmente fã número 1 dele! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durante nosso bate-papo ele conta todos os detalhes de como que o
projeto nasceu, quais foram os obstáculos que enfrentou, e quais foram
os motivos que o levou a parar o projeto. Também falamos sobre
&lt;strong&gt;BigBashView&lt;/strong&gt;, seu novo projeto&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://uniaolivre.com/"&gt;União
Livre&lt;/a&gt;, que na minha opinião promete muito, e
um &lt;strong&gt;livro&lt;/strong&gt; que esta escrevendo em parceria com um amigo, chamado
“&lt;strong&gt;Linux: Simplicidade ao seu Alcance&lt;/strong&gt;”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finalzinho do verão americano e no ar já se sente um pouco a vinda do
outono e a volta às aulas. Nada melhor então que bater um papo com
o&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Felipe Borges&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;que está participando do&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/soc/"&gt;Google Summer of
Code&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;pelo projeto&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;GNOME&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durante estes últimos meses o Felipe tem trabalhado no&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;GNOME
Documents&lt;/strong&gt;, adicionando suporte para administrar e visualizar arquivos
em dispositivos removíveis, e tendo como mentor o italiano&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Cosimo
Cecchi&lt;/strong&gt;. Mesmo com suas classes na universidade e as tarefas do próprio
projeto, o Felipe ainda assim conseguiu trabalhar e implementar o que
tinha sugerido com sua proposta, e ainda teve a oportunidade de
apresentar seu trabalho no evento &lt;strong&gt;GUADEC 2012&lt;/strong&gt; que aconteceu em&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;A
Coruña&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;na&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Espanha&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;no mês de julho!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durante nosso bate-papo ficou bem evidente que o Felipe não é o tipo de
pessoa que fica esperando as coisas acontecerem, e corre atrás das
coisas que lhe interessa. Este espírito questionador e meio que ativista
ficou bem mais óbvio uma vez que conversamos sobre os seu&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Top 5&lt;/strong&gt;,
que conta com várias surpresas bem interessantes! Mal posso esperar o
dia quando vou poder bater altos papos com o Felipe sobre política e
assuntos diversos… quem sabe no próximo&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;FISL&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pylyglot.org"&gt;Pylyglot&lt;/a&gt;, my translation searching tool
that I use whenever I translate open source applications. Have not heard
about Pylyglot? Read the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pylyglot.org/about"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page
for more info!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for the long hiatus are too many to enumerate, but suffice
to say that the project is very much alive and I intend to keep updating
the translations database as often as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what’s new? For starters, there’s a new and fancy language selector
that let’s you also search for a language as you type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Language selector" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/102224/selector.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also support for pagination as searching for certain terms could
return quite a bit of results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pagination" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/102224/pagination.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the translations are only a couple of weeks old and should be
updated again soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I removed was the ability to ask &lt;strong&gt;Google Translate&lt;/strong&gt; to
provide the translation for a term. It is very unfortunately for I was
also working on a feature that would let you upload a translation file
(e.g. nautilus.po) and get back a fully translated file, where all
strings that were changed automatically were flagged as “fuzzy” by
default so that someone could then review the end result. But alas, due
to the somewhat recent changes to Google Translate policy, I decided
that it was not worth supporting this feature anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work and my personal life has kept me busy but I still intend to
maintain this project alive and hopefully turn it into something useful
for those who work on translations. There are a few things that I’d like
to do, such as update the code to be more &lt;strong&gt;Django 1.4&lt;/strong&gt; “compliant” and
turn the process of updating translations more dynamic and “on demand”.
Unfortunately hosting Pylyglot on a shared &lt;strong&gt;Dreamhost&lt;/strong&gt; environment and
using a “shotgun” approach doesn’t work well as they have some very
restrictive memory consumption threshold for individual processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mais um dia de calor aqui na&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Carolina do Norte&lt;/strong&gt;, e mesmo na
correria desta semana eu consegui achar um pouco de tempo para
entrevistar o&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Cristiano Costa&lt;/strong&gt;,
aka&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/#!/caccac"&gt;&amp;#64;caccac&lt;/a&gt;, do podcast&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.horadomac.com/"&gt;Hora do
Mac&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;strong&gt;HDM&lt;/strong&gt;)! Quem ainda não conhece
o&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;HDM&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;não sabe o que está perdendo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;HDM&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;começou à quase 4 anos no fimzinho de 2008 lá em&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Porto
Alegre&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;e desde então o podcast já publicou&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;82 episódios&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;e só tem
aumentado em tamanho de equipe (divertidíssima diga-se de passagem),
qualidade de assuntos, e popularidade. Hoje em dia conta com uma base de
usuários super fiéis e até mesmo aparece dentre os podcasts mais
destacados no&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;iTunes&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesmo tendo somente uma hora (meu almoço) para conversar com o
Cristiano, ainda assim deu tempo de conversar sobre como que tudo
começou e como que foi gravado o primeiro episódio no dia 20 de outubro
de 2008. Conversamos sobre o processo de gravar um podcast e como que o
podcast evoluiu nos últimos anos. Também falamos sobre como que muitos
usuários de&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;são atraídos pelo&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Mac OS&lt;/strong&gt;, consumismo
de música, livros e conteúdo digital, sobre o seu blog e gosto pela
gastronomia e vários outros assuntos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olá pessoal e sejam muito bem-vindos à mais um episódio! No começo deste
ano eu tinha prometido fazer uma série especial sobre os primeiros
membros do&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu Brasil&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;e como tudo começou (quem ainda não
escutou o episódio com o&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/rodrigo-belem-ubuntu-brasil/"&gt;Rodrigo
Belém&lt;/a&gt;?), mas
nem sempre é fácil conseguir arrumar um tempinho para bater um papo com
estas pessoas. Felizmente, nesta última semana, consegui bater um papo
com o&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Fábio Nogueira&lt;/strong&gt;, um dos primeiros integrantes e membro das
primeiras “safras” de pioneiros da comunidade Ubuntu Brasil!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durante nosso bate-papo o Fábio conta como que sua participação nesta
comunidade começou no finalzinho de 2005, ao pedir ajuda com certas
configurações, e sobre sua subida meteórica que eventualmente o levou a
se tornar membro do&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Conselho Ubuntu Brasil&lt;/strong&gt;! Ele também conversa
sobre os “tempos dourados” da comunidade, comparando com a situação
atual e fazendo sugestões sobre como que a comunidade poderia ajudar
hoje em dia. Também conversamos sobre o relacionamento&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Canonical&lt;/strong&gt;,
projetos open source e a comunidade no Brasil, sobre seu interesse
pelo&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Elvis Presley&lt;/strong&gt;, filmes de zumbi, e uma pequena homenagem
ao&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;André Gondim&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;e&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Raphael Higino&lt;/strong&gt;, duas pessoas que foram muito
importante no mundo de software livre no Brasil que infelizmente já não
estão mais conosco.&lt;/p&gt;

wasn’t work related… so here’s a list, in no particular order, of what I
have been doing these days for those who were wondering what had
happened to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been asked to &lt;strong&gt;step into a new role at work&lt;/strong&gt;, and for the last
2-3 months I have been acting as the &lt;strong&gt;team lead&lt;/strong&gt; (no job title change
yet). As such, my day to day routine has changed dramatically, and I now
spend most of my time planning, organizing and building up our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of building our team involves spending some time getting to know my
&lt;strong&gt;teammates who are spread across 3 different countries and timezones&lt;/strong&gt;.
We have been using &lt;strong&gt;Google Hangout&lt;/strong&gt; for our weekly status meetings and
the ability to not only hear but see one another has definitely changed
for the better how we interact with each other. Every and single one of
my teammates are awesome and bring something unique and special to the
team!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;strong&gt;started working full time from home&lt;/strong&gt; and no longer have to do
the 50 miles/day commute to the office. I’ve had the opportunity to work
remotely before (twice a week) and I’m very comfortable with the idea.
As a matter of fact, I feel that I work harder and longer hours when I’m
home, as there are no cues to tell me to take breaks or that I have to
go home. Since &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.redhat.com/"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt; seems to have been
designed with a distributed/spread work force, there are quite a lot of
people who work remotely and all interaction is done via irc/email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project is actually a community driven, open project:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://katello.org/"&gt;Katello&lt;/a&gt;. Being able to tell people what I work
on and show them the source code is something I find priceless! For the
first time in my life I work for a company where “upstream” belongs to
the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also started learning both &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://clojure.org/"&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs"&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; for work. Having spent the
last 5-6 years as a “&lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt; guy” and &lt;strong&gt;Vim&lt;/strong&gt; user, this has been
by far the most radical change I’ve had to do so far. After going as far
as creating an alias that will start &lt;strong&gt;emacs -nw&lt;/strong&gt; whenever I type vim
in a console, I am starting to really enjoy the emacs + clojure
experience. I still press ESC a lot (old habits are hard to change)
though :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Been reading a lot! When I’m not reading a book, I’m catching up with
articles and news from several different sources. I use a combination of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.zite.com/"&gt;Zite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://flipboard.com/"&gt;Flipboard&lt;/a&gt;
and a few digital magazines (&lt;strong&gt;`Wired &amp;lt;http://wired.com/&amp;gt;`__&lt;/strong&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.smithsonian.com/"&gt;Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://theweek.com/"&gt;The
Week&lt;/a&gt;) for my daily news dose and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.instapaper.com/"&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; for those articles I want to
read at a later time. My &lt;strong&gt;iPad&lt;/strong&gt; has become a constant&amp;nbsp;and
reliable&amp;nbsp;companion. Some of the books I’ve read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also listen to a lot of music now that I can crank music really loud
without annoying a co-worker, so
&lt;strong&gt;`Pandora &amp;lt;http://www.pandora.com&amp;gt;`__&lt;/strong&gt;,
&lt;strong&gt;`Grooveshark &amp;lt;http://grooveshark.com/#!/ogmaciel&amp;gt;`__&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;`Radio
Paradise &amp;lt;http://www.radioparadise.com/&amp;gt;`__&lt;/strong&gt; have been a constant
presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I switched distros&lt;/strong&gt;!!! There, I said it! After &lt;strong&gt;6 years&lt;/strong&gt; running
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://foresightlinux.org"&gt;Foresight Linux&lt;/a&gt; exclusively, I have now
been running &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://fedoraproject.org/"&gt;Fedora 17&lt;/a&gt; on all of my
systems. The choice was completely work related and had nothing to do
with the current state of Foresight, its community or future (which I
can say is in very good hands by the way). Does that mean that my
involvement with Foresight will be affected? The answer, sadly, is yes.
My focus right now is fully concentrated on work and family and I don’t
think I will have the time or stamina to dedicate the amount of time
that running a GNU/Linux distribution requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to work and commitments to my family, my involvement with my pet
projects, translations and the &lt;strong&gt;GNOME Membership Committee&lt;/strong&gt; has
reached a stagnant point. Don’t be surprised if I “retire” from some of
my activities and start watching from the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of projects, I am still running my &lt;strong&gt;Brazilian
Portuguese&lt;/strong&gt;-only &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://castalio.info"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, publishing a new
episode every other week (&lt;strong&gt;40 episodes&lt;/strong&gt; and counting)! This is
something I’m totally committed to and even with my busy schedule I
still find time to enjoy doing the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also contemplating &lt;strong&gt;writing one or two books&lt;/strong&gt; in collaboration
with a good friend, but more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is it for now! 2012 has proven to be a very busy yet
fulfilling year for my entire family so far and several new and exciting
changes are coming down the pipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olá pessoal e sejam muito bem-vindos à mais um episódio, mais uma vez
com uma novidade: uma participação especial do&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Ivan Brasil Fuzzer&lt;/strong&gt;,
criador e mantenedor do web site de dicas e tutoriais
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ubuntero.com.br"&gt;Ubuntero&lt;/a&gt;! Com uma conexão&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Carolina
do Norte&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Rio Grande do Sul&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Califórnia&lt;/strong&gt;, batemos um papo
muito legal com o&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Danilo Resende&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;do&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durante nosso bate-papo, conversamos sobre como que o Danilo começou sua
carreira no Facebook, começando como estagiário ainda na faculdade,
quais os projetos que ele trabalha, sobre sua vinda do Brasil e se
acostumando à vida nos Estados Unidos, como que ele mata saudade da
família e onde que ele encontra arroz com feijão na Califórnia!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A entrevista toda foi tambêm gravada pelo&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Youtube&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;ao vivo e à
cores, com participação de alguns ouvintes e até mesmo perguntas dos
ouvintes e algumas falhas (que foram editadas no áudio hehehe).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olá pessoal e sejam muito bem-vindos à mais um episódio, desta vez com
uma novidade: vídeo com os bastidores e a prórpria entrevista pelo
&lt;strong&gt;Youtube&lt;/strong&gt;! Deixa eu explicar melhor! Depois que vi o último episódio
do &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.horadomac.com/"&gt;Hora do Mac (HDM)&lt;/a&gt; sendo gravado ao
vivo pelo Youtube usando o &lt;strong&gt;Google Hangout&lt;/strong&gt;, decidi tentar fazer a
mesma coisa para que as pessoas possam ver como que as entrevistas
acontecem e poderem também participar com perguntas durante a gravação.
Foi uma pena que na última hora meu convidado não pode usar um
computador e acabou que o &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=qmwKZKb0f-Y"&gt;primeiro
vídeo&lt;/a&gt;
só tem uma pessoa: eu! :) Mas beleza, acho que já para o próximo
episódio dá para fazer da forma que eu quero! Então depois não se
esqueçam de adicionar este podcast aqui no&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://plus.google.com/107864992170817866192/posts"&gt;Google
Plus&lt;/a&gt; e
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/#!/castaliopod"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; para saberem quando a
próxima gravação será feita.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O entrevistado deste episódio é o &lt;strong&gt;Djavan Fagundes&lt;/strong&gt;, atual coordenador
da equipe de traduções do &lt;strong&gt;GNOME Brasil&lt;/strong&gt;! Mesmo com a tempestade
pesada que eu tive aqui e os cachorros do vizinho do Djavan que
insistiram em participar da entrevista, acho que o áudio não sofreu
muito. Durante nosso bate-papo conversamos sobre como que ele começou a
fazer &lt;strong&gt;traduções&lt;/strong&gt; para o projeto GNOME e os motivos que o levaram a
fazer daquilo um trabalho mais sério, o que o levou a eventualmente se
tornar o coordenador atual! Também conversamos sobre seu projeto de
&lt;strong&gt;mapear todos os bares de Belo Horizonte&lt;/strong&gt; e melhorar a qualidade e
quantidade de mapas desta cidade (morei em BH em 1981-1982)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olá pessoal e sejam muito bem-vindos à mais um episódio! Desta vez para
comemorar o meu aniversário (que foi no dia 8 de junho, mas ainda há
tempo para comprar o meu
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/32BX7VP2GEFI1/ref=topnav_lists_1"&gt;presente&lt;/a&gt;
hehehe) tive a chance de conversar com o &lt;strong&gt;Felipe Ribeiro&lt;/strong&gt;, o único
Brasileiro que trabalha na companhia
&lt;strong&gt;`Spotify &amp;lt;http://www.spotify.com/&amp;gt;`__&lt;/strong&gt;! O Felipe é irmão do &lt;strong&gt;Flávio
Ribeiro&lt;/strong&gt; que eu entrevistei no &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/flavio-ribeiro-globo-com/"&gt;último
episódio&lt;/a&gt;, o que
me leva a pensar que existe um movimento muito forte na &lt;strong&gt;Paraíba&lt;/strong&gt; nas
áreas de educação e software livre, já que foram várias pessoas da
região que passaram por aqui. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesmo já sendo tarde na Suécia onde ele mora desde janeiro deste ano, e
de ter voltado de um happy hour que teve lá na Spotify, conversamos
sobre o seu trabalho, começando pela passagem pela Espanha na companhia
Tuenti, diferenças de culturas, climas e pessoas, e eventualmente sua
chegada na Suécia em pleno inverno (logo depois de ter passado umas
semanas no Brasil aproveitando o calorzinho em sua terra natal). Também
conversamos sobre as dificuldades que existem em fechar contratos com
gravadoras, como que cervejas são caras na Suécia, contratações e seu
Top 5!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eu gosto muito quando alguém me sugere um livro, filme, música ou pessoa
para conhecer, e depois de trocar uns e-mails com meu amigo &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/yuri-malheiros-engenharia-de-software-e-inteligencia-artificial/"&gt;Yuri
Malheiros&lt;/a&gt;
na semana passada, decidi convidar o &lt;strong&gt;Flávio Ribeiro&lt;/strong&gt; para uma
entrevista! O Flávio é um engenheiro de software que trabalha na
&lt;strong&gt;Globo.com&lt;/strong&gt; no Rio de Janeiro (na entrevista parecia que ele estava
sentado bem no meio de &lt;strong&gt;Interlagos&lt;/strong&gt; hehehe) e está na equipe
responsável por toda a área de streaming de conteúdo pela net!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durante nosos bate-papo ele me contou sobre como que sua equipe usa a
metodologia &lt;strong&gt;SCRUM&lt;/strong&gt; para administrar e planejar suas tarefas, quais as
tecnologias usadas internamente e como que o software livre faz parte do
dia-a dia da companhia, que oferece vários incentivos para que seus
empregados participem deste mundo! Ele também conta sobre sua recem
viagem à &lt;strong&gt;Nova York&lt;/strong&gt; para participar do evento &lt;strong&gt;Streaming Media East
2012&lt;/strong&gt; e sobre como foi passear por &lt;strong&gt;NYC&lt;/strong&gt; já no comecinho do verão,
tomar sorvete no parque, a decepção ao ver a &lt;strong&gt;Estátua da Liberdade&lt;/strong&gt;, e
como é difícil acompanhar os jogos do &lt;strong&gt;Treze Futebol Clube&lt;/strong&gt; lá do Rio
de Janeiro!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://clojure.org/"&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt; at work and didn’t like the idea of
using &lt;strong&gt;Eclipse&lt;/strong&gt; for my day to day work… so I started looking at how to
make &lt;strong&gt;vim&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;clojure&lt;/strong&gt; get along and came across a great
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://writequit.org/blog/?p=386"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;! Here are the distilled
notes plus minor tweaks to get anyone out there trying to do the same
thing going:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download &lt;strong&gt;VimClojure&lt;/strong&gt;
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2501"&gt;http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2501&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download &lt;strong&gt;VimSlime&lt;/strong&gt;
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime"&gt;https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract these files into your &lt;strong&gt;~/.vim&lt;/strong&gt; folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the following lines to &lt;strong&gt;~/.vimrc&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot; Settings for VimClojure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let vimclojure#HighlightBuiltins = 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let vimclojure#ParenRainbow = 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot; Send entire file to repl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nmap &amp;lt;C-m&amp;gt; ggVG&amp;lt;C-c&amp;gt;&amp;lt;C-c&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a repl session inside screen:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;screen -S clojure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lein repl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a clojure file with vim and highlight the method you want to
evaluate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press ctrl + c twice&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For session name prompt, enter ‘clojure’ which is the name of the
screen session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For window name prompt, accept the default number displayed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The selected code should be evaluated in the screen session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press ctrl + c, v to get prompt again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Vim and Clojure sitting on a tree" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/102224/vim_clojure.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTES&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I chose to start a repl using
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen"&gt;lein&lt;/a&gt; but you can use
whatever you’re familar with to get a repl started&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have lein inside a directory in my &lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt; as well as all of my
vim files and plugins. I then created soft links to them in my $HOME
directory which makes this whole thing very easy to access from
different systems as long as Dropbox is installed :)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nem parece que já passaram duas semanas desde o último episódio, mas
mais uma vez tive o prazer de entrevistar uma pessoa prá lá de
interessante e divertida: o &lt;strong&gt;Caike Souza&lt;/strong&gt;! Foi durante a minha
entrevista com o &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/henrique-bastos-welcome-to-the-django/"&gt;Henrique
Bastos&lt;/a&gt;
que eu fiquei sabendo sobre ele, mas foi somente esta semana que eu fui
saber que ele trabalha na &lt;strong&gt;Envy Labs&lt;/strong&gt; desde 2009 lá em &lt;strong&gt;Orlando&lt;/strong&gt;, na
&lt;strong&gt;Flórida&lt;/strong&gt;. A companhia parece ser super bacana e está por trás de
vários projetos bacanas, como o &lt;strong&gt;Rails for Zombies&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Code School&lt;/strong&gt; e
&lt;strong&gt;TryRuby.org&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A primeira coisa que fica bem evidente sobre o Caike é que ele realmente
curte muito o que faz, tem muito orgulho de onde trabalha, e é super
humilde e divertido! Ele fala que programação é uma arte, e esta
combinação de paixão pelo que faz e arte fica bem aparente nas coisas
que ele faz! Durante nosso bate-papo conversamos sobre como que ele foi
parar em Orlando na Envy Labs, quais companhias que usam a usam os
serviços deles (e os motivos pelas quais terem escolhido isso), sua
participação na conferência &lt;strong&gt;RailsConf 2012&lt;/strong&gt;, sua banda de rock
“&lt;strong&gt;Heroes Will Fall&lt;/strong&gt;”, a história por trás do projeto&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Small
Acts Manifesto&lt;/strong&gt; e até mesmo seu &lt;strong&gt;Top 5 de pessoas para seguir no
Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esta semana eu ainda pretendo conversar com ele sobre um &lt;strong&gt;brinde&lt;/strong&gt; para
vocês brincarem mais com o Code School, mas enquanto isso, vale a pena
conferir o Rails for Zombies e baixar a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/heroeswillfall?sk=app_204974879526524"&gt;música da
banda&lt;/a&gt;
se você curte &lt;strong&gt;Heavy Metal&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(a música da entrada do episódio é da
banda)&amp;nbsp;ou quer conhecer um pouco mais sobre esta pessoa super
interessante que é o Caike!&lt;/p&gt;

dia mais que perfeito já que conseguimos ver um monte das exibições e
ainda achamos um tempinho para comer na

Kung&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;e&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Pedro Belo&lt;/strong&gt;, que atualmente trabalham na companhia
Californiana&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Heroku&lt;/strong&gt;! Se você escutou os dois últimos episódios,
você deve se lembrar que eu mencionei sobre esta companhia com
o&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/henrique-bastos-welcome-to-the-django/"&gt;Henrique
Bastos&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;e&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/julio-monteiro-jobscore/"&gt;Júlio
Monteiro&lt;/a&gt;, e como
que eu tenho usado os serviços que eles oferecem para hospedar e rodar
alguns dos meus projetos. Então quando o Júlio se ofereceu para me
apresentar ao pessoal da Heroku eu aceitei na mesma hora!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nosso bate-papo foi super divertido, e mesmo com os&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;três fusos de
horário diferentes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(o Fábio na&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;California&lt;/strong&gt;, Pedro
no&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Texas&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;e eu na&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Carolina do Norte&lt;/strong&gt;) conseguimos conversar
sobre vários assuntos, incluindo uma explicação sobre o que significa
Plataforma como Serviço (&lt;strong&gt;PaaS&lt;/strong&gt;), o que a Heroku tem para oferecer
comparado com a competição, contratações no mundo do software livre,
vida no exterior, caipirinhas, bicicletas, ping-pong e mais!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tem também um &lt;strong&gt;brinde&lt;/strong&gt; super especial para as três primeiras pessoas
que responderem a pergunta lá no &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; do

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2y9r6Wdw31r7yex1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Reitz&lt;/strong&gt;'s recent
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kennethreitz.com/repository-structure-and-python.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;
and spurred by recent events, I decided to turn an old python code I
wrote a while back into something that can be (hopefully) easier to get
to than by sheer luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m talking about
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://omaciel.github.com/choppedpress/"&gt;ChoppedPress&lt;/a&gt;, my script
that let’s you split &lt;strong&gt;WordPress&lt;/strong&gt; exported &lt;strong&gt;XML files&lt;/strong&gt; into smaller
files that can be easily imported into new WordPress installations. I’m
sure that some of you have experienced the frustration of not being able
to import this xml file due to size upload constraints on your host
providers… One of my close friends who provides mostly support for
WordPress gave me the idea a while back and that is how the script came
about. Little did I know that
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://snarfed.org/pyblosxom2wxr"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.ivandemarino.me/2010/10/12/From-Wordpress-to-Bloggart"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt;
have find it useful too, specially for migrating &lt;strong&gt;*away*&lt;/strong&gt; from
WordPress! As a matter of fact, I too used it when I moved to
&lt;strong&gt;Tumblr&lt;/strong&gt;, but that another story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this afternoon I took some time during my lunch break to create a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/omaciel/choppedpress"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; and put
together some very basic structure to give &lt;strong&gt;ChoppedPress&lt;/strong&gt; a proper
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://omaciel.github.com/choppedpress/"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; (yay &lt;strong&gt;GitHub
Pages&lt;/strong&gt;!!!). For the first time I also uploaded something I created to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/choppedpress/0.0.1"&gt;PyPi&lt;/a&gt;… Sure, this
may not be a big deal to some of you out there, but I can hardly contain
my excitement. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’m still enjoying a nice buzz from the experience. Obviously,
I look forward to comments, suggestions and/or improvements to the code,
but more than anything, I hope this will be useful to you too!&lt;/p&gt;

ou &lt;strong&gt;Django&lt;/strong&gt; no seu dia-a-dia, eu decidi entrevistar alguém que
trabalha com o framework &lt;strong&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/strong&gt; para este episódio! Dentre as
pessoas que eu conheço (online e pessoalmente) o nome do &lt;strong&gt;Júlio
Monteiro&lt;/strong&gt; foi o primeiro que passou pela minha cabeça.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eu e o Júlio nos conhecemos na época que participávamos da comunidade
&lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu Brasil&lt;/strong&gt;, mas desde então eu tinha perdido um pouco de contato
com ele, até descobrir que ele estava trabalhando para a &lt;strong&gt;JobScore&lt;/strong&gt;
com Ruby on Rails. A JobScore que tem sua sede em &lt;strong&gt;San Francisco&lt;/strong&gt; na
&lt;strong&gt;Califórnia&lt;/strong&gt;, fornece um serviço de gestão de currículos, trabalhos e
candidatos para aquelas companhias que querem contratar alguém mas não
querem lidar com o processo de publicar as ofertas de trabalho ou
gerenciar todos os e-mails que sejam enviados.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durante nosos bate-papo, o Júlio então conta a sua jornada até a
JobScore, tudo &lt;strong&gt;começando com uma queda da escada&lt;/strong&gt; de sua casa! Depois
de aprender &lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt; com uma revista que sua mãe comprou, ele tomou o
gosto pela programação para web, e desde então não parou mais.
Conversamos sobre como ele administrava aulas de Ruby, por que usa Ruby
on Rails, seu dia-a-dia na JobScore, sua experiência em San Francisco e
como que as companhias por lá dão mais valor aos empregados, e o seu Top
5!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Há mais ou menos 1 anos e meio atrás eu tinha começado a aprender a
programar com o framework &lt;strong&gt;Django&lt;/strong&gt; e durante minhas pesquisas pela net
encontrei o projeto do &lt;strong&gt;Henrique Bastos&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Welcome to the Django&lt;/strong&gt;.
Não demorou muito para ver a qualidade e o potencial que este curso
oferece, e desde então eu tenho acompanhado o trabalho que o Henrique
tem feito! Nesta última quinta eu tive a oportunidade de bater um
bate-papo com ele via Skype, e entrevistá-lo para este episódio!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanto o Welcome to the Django quanto a &lt;strong&gt;Dekode&lt;/strong&gt;, companhia que evoluiu
da mesma, mostram o entusiasmo e a competência que o Henrique tem pelo
que faz. Ambos projetos nasceram da sua vontade de compartilhar seu
conhecimento acumulado nas áreas de programação e gestão de projetos com
software livre, e foi muito interessante escutar sobre como cada um
nasceu e evoluiu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durante nosso bate-papo o Henrique nos conta sobre o seu projeto e como
que invés de ensinar o be-a-bá, ele usa e abusa de técnicas de
desenvolvimento ágil, deployment first, &lt;strong&gt;Heroku&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Github&lt;/strong&gt; e muita
interação para uma experiência rica e didática de dar inveja a muitos
cursos por ai! Depois ele conta como que nasceu a Dekode, sua companhia
de desenvolvedores “&lt;strong&gt;black belt&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; criada para providenciar um
serviço de apoio &amp;quot;nível 2&amp;quot; para aquelas horas do aperto. Também falamos
sobre a comunidade &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt; do Brasil, &lt;strong&gt;`Small
Acts &amp;lt;http://smallactsmanifesto.org/&amp;gt;`__&lt;/strong&gt;, apresentações pelos Estados
Unidos, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.datacassete.com.br/"&gt;revista INPUT&lt;/a&gt; (quem já teve
um computador &lt;strong&gt;TK85&lt;/strong&gt; ou &lt;strong&gt;ZX Spectrum&lt;/strong&gt; sabe do que estou falando), e
mais um monte coisas bacanas!&lt;/p&gt;

online viewers means I won't be reading their &lt;strong&gt;Books section&lt;/strong&gt; anymore.
It sort of became a good habit for me and something I look forward to on
Sunday mornings: as I drink my coffee and enjoy some peace and quietness
as the kids are still asleep, I enjoy catching up with the latest books
and reviews. This weekend ritual usually ends with a trip down to the
public library with the whole family. Both of my kids are already
checking out more books and movies than my wife and I together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to this decision by the NY Times, I understand that a for
profit establishment wants to, well, make money, and there’s nothing
wrong with that for sure. But for this weekend, Books section only
reader the options don’t make a lot of sense: &lt;strong&gt;pay $6 for the Sunday
edition&lt;/strong&gt; so I can read a small subset of it is a bit expensive, and I
am not very sure how much it costs to get the online version.&lt;/p&gt;

Programmers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Og Maciel,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just to let you know that &lt;em&gt;Pragmatic Guide to Git (eBook)&lt;/em&gt;
has recently been updated. You own an electronic version of this
book, and so you’ll be able to download this latest version. We have
also sent it to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://Amazon.com/"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; for delivery to
your kindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes in This Release&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third printing: includes a few minor errata fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the update either by logging in to your &lt;strong&gt;Bookshelf Home
Page&lt;/strong&gt;, or (if you’re already logged in) by downloading it from
&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave and Andy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;` &amp;lt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pragmaticbookshelf.com/"&gt;http://pragmaticbookshelf.com/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;`__&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pragmaticbookshelf.com"&gt;http://pragmaticbookshelf.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome right? They not only have informed me of an updated version of a
book I bought from them, but have also automatically sent it to my
&lt;strong&gt;Kindle&lt;/strong&gt;! More over, I can download my ebook in &lt;strong&gt;PDF&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;mobi&lt;/strong&gt; or
&lt;strong&gt;epub&lt;/strong&gt; format, all without any senseless “protection mechanism”. It is
this type of attention and treatment that have won me over and whenever
I need to buy a technical book, I immediately check their store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also worth mentioning is their monthly, free publication &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pragprog.com/magazines"&gt;PragPub
magazine&lt;/a&gt;, also available in many
different electronic types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I don’t get any type of financial incentive for writing this up,
so don’t feel that I’m trying to push off some type of affiliation code
in order to make money. I happen to enjoy their service and attitude
toward their customers and, if you’re ever decide to buy anything from
them I hope your experience will be as enjoyable as mine.&lt;/p&gt;

como o mundo do software livre pode abrir as portas do mundo

ferramentas bacanas para o&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;GNOME&lt;/strong&gt;, passando por sua estadia

trabalha com automatização de processos, este episódio é garantido de te
deixar super animado (“ou eu não me chamo Raimundo Donato!!!”)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A parte mais impressionante para mim durante a entrevista foi o
entusiasmo genuíno que o Gabriel tem pelo que faz! Do começo ao fim, e
mesmo durante o nosso bate-papo depois que terminamos a gravação,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;a
empolgação dele é super contagiante&lt;/strong&gt;! Já combinamos de tomar um café
este julho quando eu for à NYC visitar meus pais, e quem sabe, fazer um

recebi a seguinte mensagem por e-mail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations for reaching 90 days of service with Red Hat!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;É difícil de acreditar que já se passaram 3 meses desde que eu comecei
este novo capítulo na minha carreira! Meus dias têm sido preenchidos com
tantas novidades que isso talvez ajude a explicar porque parece que foi
somente ontem que eu sai da &lt;strong&gt;rPath&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;para ingressar na
equipe&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;CloudForms QE&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;aqui na&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eu ainda estou passando pela transição de sair de uma companhia startup
com um ambiente de trabalho prá lá de ágil e rápido, para uma companhia
(beeeem) maior tentando resolver um problema similar. Não tem um dia
sequer que eu não conheço alguem novo ou não aprendo mais um novo truque
do &lt;strong&gt;YUM&lt;/strong&gt; ou &lt;strong&gt;RPM&lt;/strong&gt;. Tentar lembrar os nomes, rostos, onde que cada um
senta e o que fazem tem sido uma árdua tarefa mas acredito que estou
progredindo. Por ser uma companhia global, nem sempre é obvio de onde
que aquela pessoa que você passou horas trabalhando em um problema pelo
IRC é…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Então nestes últimos 3 meses eu tenho aprendido tudo que é possível
absorver sobre o zilhão de projetos diferentes que existem por aqui!
Sinto que já aprendi bastante mas tem muito, muito mais para aprender
ainda, que é muito massa! Quando penso no número de pessoas talentosas
que trabalham aqui, e o calibre e entusiasmo das pessoas que trabalham
comigo mais a magnitude dos desafios que estão por vir, é difícil nao
sentir que estou no lugar certo na hora certa!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tem como ficar melhor ainda? Tem sim! Pela primeira vez na minha vida
posso falar com orgulho que tudo que eu trabalho é &lt;strong&gt;realmente código
livre e aberto&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;com uma comunidade ativa de colaboradores &lt;strong&gt;fora do meu
trabalho&lt;/strong&gt;! Ou seja, qualquer pessoa que seja de fora da Red Hat pode
ver quais tarefas eu estou trabalhando, quais estão na minha fila para
fazer e até mesmo fazer o download e brincar com o&amp;nbsp;código do projeto!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Não é exagero então que eu falo que os últimos 90+ dias têm sido um
período de muito aprendizado e eu estou realmente super animado sobre os
próximos meses e todas as coisas bacanas que ainda estão por vir
aí!&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;É uma excelente época para ser um membro da Red Hat!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

greeted early in the morning with the following email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations for reaching 90 days of service with Red Hat!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard for me to believe that it has been 3 months already since I
started this new chapter in my career! My days have been filled with so
many new things that it may explain why it literally feels like it was
only yesterday that I left &lt;strong&gt;rPath&lt;/strong&gt; to join the &lt;strong&gt;CloudForms QE Team&lt;/strong&gt;
here at &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still going through the transition period of coming off a startup,
super fast paced environment to a (much, much) bigger company trying to
solve a similar challenge. There is not a single day that goes by that I
don’t meet someone new or learn yet a new trick about &lt;strong&gt;YUM&lt;/strong&gt; or
&lt;strong&gt;RPM&lt;/strong&gt;. Keeping track of names, faces, where they sit and what they do
has been a challenge on its own, but I believe I’m making some progress.
Being the global company that we are, it is not always obvious where the
person you spent the last few hours working on IRC is from…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the last 3 months I’ve been learning all I can absorb about all
the different projects that are being developed here! I feel that I have
learned a lot but there is still a lot to learn, which is awesome! When
I think about the massive talent pool that we have and the caliber and
enthusiasm of my co-workers, plus the magnitude of the challenges ahead
and the impact that our projects will have in the enterprise world, I
can’t help but feel that I am at the right place and at the right time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I top this off? Yes, I can! For the first time in my life I can
proudly say that everything that I work on is &lt;strong&gt;not only truly open
sourced&lt;/strong&gt; but have a &lt;strong&gt;thriving community of collaborators outside
work&lt;/strong&gt;! In other words, anyone from outside Red Hat can see the issues
I’ve worked on, what’s currently assigned to me and even download and
play with the source code of the project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So these first 90+ days have been a blur of excitement and learning for
me and I’m really excited about the upcoming months and all the good
stuff that is yet to come down the pipe! &lt;strong&gt;It is a great time to be a
Red Hatter!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olá pessoal e sejam bem-vindos ao segundo
episódio de 2012! Esta última semana tive a oportunidade de conversar
com o &lt;strong&gt;Ivan Brasil Fuzzer&lt;/strong&gt;, criador e mantenedor do web site de dicas
e tutoriais &amp;nbsp;Ubuntero! Junto com uma equipe de colaboradores, o Ivan
escreve artigos sobre todas as áreas relacionadas à tecnologia e
tutorias, focando na área de software livre!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A história do Ubuntero me lembra um pouco a história do
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://br-linux.org/"&gt;BR-Linux&lt;/a&gt;, começando como um catálogo de
informações úteis para o Ivan e eventualmente tornando-se em um ponto de
parada para todos aqueles usuários de Linux que procuram dicas e truques
para lidarem com suas configurações. Com o passar dos tempos seu projeto
deixou de ser somente “mais um blog sobre Linux” e expandiu para outras
vias de comunicação, como um &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ubunterobr?feature=watch"&gt;canal de
vídeos&lt;/a&gt; no
&lt;strong&gt;Youtube&lt;/strong&gt; e seu mais recente projeto, o &lt;strong&gt;Opencast&lt;/strong&gt; podcast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durante nosso bate-papo o Ivan conta sobre como que o site Ubuntero
nasceu, de onde ele busca informações, algumas estatísticas do site, e
como que depois de um tempo nasceram o canal de vídeos e o podcast. Ele
também conta sobre quais ferramentas ele usa para gerar e editar o
conteúdo de seus projetos, planos para o futuro, terminando com a sua
previsão para o Ubuntu Linux em 2012!&lt;/p&gt;

bem-vindos a mais um novo episódio, este comemorando nosso &lt;strong&gt;primeiro
ano no ar&lt;/strong&gt;! Aproveitei a oportunidade então para dar o pontapé inicial
em uma nova série, desta vez focada na criação do Ubuntu Brasil!!! Ame-a
ou não, a distribuição &lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/strong&gt; teve uma história meteórica dentre os
usuários de Linux brasileiros, e hoje em dia ainda continua liderando
dentre as distribuições mais usadas no país. Mas como foi que tudo
começou? Quem foram os responsáveis por “trazer” o Ubuntu ao Brasil e
como que eles conseguiram atrair tantos usuários e apoiadores em tão
pouco tempo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apresento então a vocês o &lt;strong&gt;Rodrigo Belém&lt;/strong&gt;, que junto ao &lt;strong&gt;Ian
Lawrence&lt;/strong&gt;, fundaram o &lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu Brasil&lt;/strong&gt; no finalzinho de 2004! Durante
nosso bate-papo, o Rodrigo conta como que tudo começou depois de escutar
umas palestras no &lt;strong&gt;DebConf&lt;/strong&gt; em &lt;strong&gt;Porto alegre&lt;/strong&gt;, e uma viagem à
&lt;strong&gt;Espanha&lt;/strong&gt;! Sobre a visita do &lt;strong&gt;Mark Shuttleworth&lt;/strong&gt; ao &lt;strong&gt;Amazonas&lt;/strong&gt; e
os desafios dos primeiros meses de vida da distribuição! Aprenda um
pouco sobre os fatores que tornaram o Ubuntu tão popular e o nome de
vários usuários que começaram sua vida no mundo de software livre na
comunidade Ubuntu Brasil!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Escutem o novo

antigos do &lt;strong&gt;WordPress&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;eu sem querer iniciei uma enxurrada onde certos
agregadores estão mostrando&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;posts de 2007&lt;/strong&gt;… Ontem eu também
causei um problema similar no &lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt; e &lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

despretenciosa, foi publicado o primeiro episódio do &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://castalio.info"&gt;Castálio
Podcast&lt;/a&gt;! Veterano de alguns podcast nos
últimos anos (quem ainda se lembra do &lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu Brasil&lt;/strong&gt; e
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://foocast.wordpress.com/"&gt;Foocast&lt;/a&gt; podcasts?), foi com um pouco
de incerteza que eu decidi iniciar este projeto “com o objetivo de
entrevistar e ao mesmo tempo apresentar pessoas e projetos que sejam
fonte de inspiração para os ouvintes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;O Castalio é sensacional e muito bem feito. O Og conduz tudo muito
bem e as entrevistas são descontraídas, de uma forma bem natural. Os
entrevistados também são sempre especiais e interessantes, pois são
parte da grupo que realmente fazem algo para a comunidade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A verdade é que sempre que escuto o Castalio me dá aquela vontade de
estar em uma mesa de bar com o Og e o entrevistado. Enfim, esse
podcast é extremamente recomendado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah! E, por favor, alguém entreviste o Og algum dia.” - &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hdoria.com/"&gt;Hugo
Doria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invés de juntar com uns amigos e discutir sobre tecnologia e assuntos do
dia, eu queria fazer algo um pouco mais diferente e evitar aquela rotina
típica, e fazer um programa no estilo entrevistas, igual aos “talk
shows” que passam tarde da noite na televisão. E foi mais ou menos com
esta meta que eu iniciei o processo de entrevistar uma pessoa de 15&amp;nbsp;em
15 dias, e publicar um episódio da forma mais profissional possível.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;Bate-papo informal com nomes de que você encontra facilmente em
listas de discussões na Internet? Castalio podcast é o lugar.&amp;quot; -
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://diegobz.net/"&gt;Diego Búrigo Zacarão&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durante o percurso dos últimos 12 meses eu tive de aprender muitas
coisas relacionadas ao processo de edição de áudio, uma coisa que até
então era “terra incognita” para mim. Dependendo do microfone do
convidado, da qualidade da internet e do ambiente onde eu, aqui na
Carolina do Norte, e meu convidado, em algum lugar no Brasil na maioria
das vezes, eu tinha de aprender um novo truque ou técnica para melhorar
a qualidade do áudio, remover ruídos, ou até mesmo fazer o bate-papo
mais fluído sem longas pausas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;Acompanho o Castálio Podcast há algum tempo e o considero uma
excelente voz para os membros da comunidade livre brasileira.
Informativo, mas sempre na forma de uma conversa agradável! Além
disso, também está se tornando um verdadeiro ‘portal do tempo’ que
permite aos membros recentes saberem mais sobre os primórdios.
Parabéns ao Og pela iniciativa e por todo o esforço!&amp;quot; - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/polly"&gt;Marcelo
Hashimoto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ao mesmo tempo que eu queria publicar um áudio legal, eu também queria
providenciar mais informações sobre os tópicos discutidos no episódio
para que o ouvinte pudesse depois buscar mais informações na internet.
Foi aí que eu comecei a incluir links para todos os termos, assuntos,
músicas, filmes, e livros que de uma certa forma compoem a vida do
convidado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entre a composição do post que acompanha todos os episódios, e a edição
do áudio, eu gastava no mínimo umas 4 ou 5 horas. Como isso acontecia de
2&amp;nbsp;em 2 semanas, até que não era tão ruim, mas como eu ainda estava
trabalhando uma média de 60+ horas por semana, e ao mesmo tempo
desempenhando o papel de pai para duas filhas que querem (e com razão) a
presença e total atenção de seu pai em casa, eu percebi que eu precisava
fazer algo para melhorar o meu trabalho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;O Podcast do OgMaciel é uma contribuição ímpar para as comunidades
de Software Livre no Brasil. Sem essas histórias de bastidores, a
essência das comunidades se perde pois as comunidades são feitas de
pessoas e suas iniciativas e motivações pessoais. Em suma, esta é a
verdadeira história do SL no Brasil e você está contando! Parabéns,
Og!&amp;quot; - &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://softwarelivre.org/acris/blog"&gt;acris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para quem não sabe, profissionalmente eu trabalho na criação de testes e
automatização de máquinas virtuais, e quando não estou lidando com as
coisas relacionadas do trabalho, estou sempre criando alguns
programinhas (scripts) para simplificar os processos repetitivos do meu
dia a dia, por mais insignificantes que elas possam parecer para outros.
Se existe algo que eu tenho de executar várias vezes por dia, vários
dias na semana, logo, logo eu tento automatizar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Não demorou muito para eu escrever um programa em Python para
automatizar a geração do código HTML que eu uso para escrever o sumário,
e adicionar links para todos os termos, músicas (pelo Last.FM), filmes
(pelo IMDB), e livros (pelo Amazon.com). Como eu tomo notas de tudo que
acontece na entrevista durante a edição do áudio, é só passar estas
notas para o meu programa, e pronto!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;Participar do Castálio Podcast foi, sem dúvida, uma das
oportunidades mais interessantes que tive na comunidade de código
aberto. Entretanto, melhor do que isso foi conhecer meus próprios
amigos e colegas sob uma perspectiva diferente, por meio de
episódios sempre divertidos e inusitados.&amp;quot; - &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://igorsoares.com/"&gt;Igor
Soares&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uma vez que eu demorava menos tempo compondo o post, eu tive mais tempo
para me dedicar a pesquisar mais sobre os entrevistados, montar uma
pauta (se bem que as entrevistas são tão informais que nem precisa de
uma) e descobrir algumas coisinhas que não são tão conhecidas do
público, como, se a pessoa pratica algum esporte, gosta de cozinhar,
sonha em conhecer a Austrália, estes tipos de coisas. Foram várias vezes
que eu peguei alguns convidados de surpresa ao perguntar sobre coisas
que eles provavelmente pensavam que ninguem sabia. Na minha opinião,
isso só ajudou a descontrair o bate-papo e mostrar o lado mais “humano”
da pessoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bem, hoje então estou celebrando o primeiro ano de vida do podcast!
Publicando um novo episódio a cada 2 semanas, com direito a episódios
especias fora de hora (como o episódio em homenagem ao &lt;strong&gt;André Gondim&lt;/strong&gt;
e sobre o &lt;strong&gt;Conectiva Linux&lt;/strong&gt;), eu sei que eu não estaria celebrando
este marco tão importante se não fosse pela paciência, entusiasmo e
disponibilidade dos meus convidados, e sem o apoio dos amigos e de todos
vocês que participam com comentários e e-mails desde o primeiro dia de
vida!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;Feliz aniversário! O Castálio Podcast foi uma das melhores
novidades de 2011, e é bom ver ele evoluindo para trazer séries
(como a que conversou com várias pessoas que fizeram o histórico dos
tempos áureos da Conectiva, e a próxima série que vai tratar da
comunidade nacional de outra distribuição) que expõem detalhes que
mesmo os participantes das comunidades em questão geralmente
desconhecem, e o fazem de maneira leve e interessante. Continue com
o sucesso!&amp;quot; - &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://augustocampos.net/"&gt;Augusto Campos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Então muitíssimo obrigado a todos vocês que, de uma forma ou outra
participaram do processo deste projeto, e espero poder trazer uma nova
série de entrevistados e assuntos neste ano de 2012, e poder
compartilhar com vocês um pouco de destes bate-papos prá lá de
interessantes e divertidos!&lt;/p&gt;

uma reunião com a equipe do&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu Brasil&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;em 2006, os problemas
que enfrentou no começo, o progama de “beta testers” para professores, e
os objetivos para as próximas fases do projeto. Ela conta como que a
palavra “&lt;strong&gt;kernel&lt;/strong&gt;” acabou sendo traduzida como “&lt;strong&gt;semente&lt;/strong&gt;“,
como que largou&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;10 computadores usando Windows&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;por um sistema
rodando&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Fedora Linux&lt;/strong&gt;, suas preferências musicais, e a forma mais

&lt;p&gt;Olá pessoal! Sejam muito bem-vindos a mais um episódio, o segundo deste
ano! O convidado de hoje é o &lt;strong&gt;Marcelo Hashimoto&lt;/strong&gt;, desenvolvedor do
cliente de &lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt; chamado &lt;strong&gt;Polly&lt;/strong&gt;! Se você curte programar com

uma olhadinho no programa do Marcelo. Ultimamente o Polly tem atraído
bastante atenção, especialmente depois de ter saído em sites como o

Brasil&lt;/a&gt;! Durante nosso bate-papo, o
Marcelo conta porque decidiu criar “mais um cliente para o Twitter”, o
que faz ele destacar dos outros, a história do nome do projeto (você
sabia que o nome original do projeto era &lt;strong&gt;schizobird&lt;/strong&gt;?), como lidar
com usuários nos forums de pergunta, sobre seu doutorado, e o seu Top 5!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olá pessoal e sejam muito bem-vindos ao &lt;strong&gt;primeiro episódio de 2012&lt;/strong&gt;!
Desta vez entrevistei o &lt;strong&gt;Rodrigo Padula&lt;/strong&gt;, amigo de algum tempo pela
internet nas traduções do projeto &lt;strong&gt;GNOME&lt;/strong&gt;. O Rodrigo tem um currículo
bastante extensivo trabalhando em vários dos projetos de software livre,
e durante nosso bate-papo ele conta sobre como tudo começou. &lt;strong&gt;Usuário
de Linux desde 1997&lt;/strong&gt;, ele participou da formação e organização do
&lt;strong&gt;Projeto Fedora no Brasil&lt;/strong&gt;, participando de várias conferências e
iniciativas visando o crescimento do projeto na &lt;strong&gt;América Latina&lt;/strong&gt;. Sua
participação e desempenho não passou despercebido pela &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt;,
companhia por trás do projeto Fedora, o que eventualmente o levou a
trabalhar para esta companhia Americana por um período na área de
marketing e comunidades. O Rodrigo também participa ativamente de outros
projetos de software livre, como o &lt;strong&gt;Mozilla&lt;/strong&gt; e &lt;strong&gt;GNOME&lt;/strong&gt;, dos quais
hoje faz parte de forma oficial. Aproveitei então para perguntar para
ele sua opinião sobre o último lançamento do &lt;strong&gt;GNOME Shell&lt;/strong&gt; e a escolha
da nova diretora da &lt;strong&gt;Fundação GNOME&lt;/strong&gt;! Por último, conversamos sobre o
&lt;strong&gt;Laboratório de Open Source&lt;/strong&gt; na &lt;strong&gt;UFRJ&lt;/strong&gt; onde trabalha, por que ele
faz &lt;strong&gt;Jiu-Jitsu&lt;/strong&gt;, planos para 2012, e seu &lt;strong&gt;Top 5&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escute agora&lt;/strong&gt;:

&lt;p&gt;Desde que eu comecei a fazer o meu programa de podcasts (para quem ainda
não conhece, chama-se &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/about/"&gt;Castálio&lt;/a&gt;)
que eu tenho pensado em escrever este post, mas por um motivo ou outro,
nunca chegou a passar da idéia. O lance é que quando o podcast começou,
eu ainda não tinha um formato concreto de como iria fazer as
entrevistas, e como o primeiro episódio foi uma &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/episodio-0-og-maciel/"&gt;entrevista comigo
mesmo&lt;/a&gt;, eu não tive
uma oportunidade de falar sobre o meu &lt;strong&gt;Top 5&lt;/strong&gt;, que é uma coisa que
hoje eu pergunto a todos os meus entrevistados já no finalzinho das
entrevistas. O Top 5 é uma das minhas partes favoritas, porque me deixa
conhecer sobre quais &lt;strong&gt;músicas, filmes, livros, histórias, artistas&lt;/strong&gt; e
&lt;strong&gt;pessoas&lt;/strong&gt; que influenciaram a vida das pessoas com quem estou
conversando! Então, acabou que eu nunca tive a oportunidade de falar
sobre as coisas que influenciaram a minha vida… e em vez de fazer um
novo episódio sobre mim mesmo (mas a possibilidade ainda existe, quem
sabe?), decidi compartilhar aqui com você, leitor do meu blog, seja pelo
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://planeta.ubuntu-br.org/"&gt;Planeta Ubuntu Brasil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://planeta.gnulinuxbrasil.org"&gt;Planeta
GNU/Linux Brasil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://planeta.br.gnome.org/"&gt;Planeta GNOME
Brasil&lt;/a&gt;, ou qualquer outra forma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antes de mais nada, eu não poderia falar sobre quais foram os livros ou
autores que mais me marcaram sem mencionar o nome das pessoas
responsáveis por este “vício” tão bom que eu tenho desde pequeno: a
leitura. Primeiramente, &lt;strong&gt;meus pais&lt;/strong&gt; foram mais que primordiais em
cultivar em mim este hábito! Quando eu era ainda criança, meus pais
sempre compravam livros, seja para um de nós (tenho 2 irmãs), ou seja
para eles mesmos, e eu sempre ficava maravilhado ao ver aqueles livros
todos enfileirados nas várias prateleiras que adornavam nossa casa. E
não era só de enfeite não! Se meus pais não estavam lendo livros,
estavam folheando revistas, catálogos, búla de remédios… e foi com eles
que tudo começou!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A segunda influência que eu tive ainda novinho foi minha professora da
terceira série lá em &lt;strong&gt;São Franciso, MG&lt;/strong&gt;, Dona &lt;strong&gt;Maria Teresa
Mendonça&lt;/strong&gt; (que era também mãe do meu amigo &lt;strong&gt;Rúbens Mendonça&lt;/strong&gt; “Pé de
Pato, Mão de Onça” :))! Foi na terceira série que ela criou o &lt;strong&gt;Clube do
Livro&lt;/strong&gt; e nos presenteou com um armário lotado de livros de todos os
gêneros! Foi neste ano que eu aprendi a apreciar ainda mais a leitura, e
foi devido à esta professora que eu nunca mais parei de ler!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Então vamos lá, aqui segue uma compilação meio que ainda tentativa dos
10 mais importantes livros ou autores que influenciaram a minha vida de
uma forma ou outra:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.livrariasaraiva.com.br/produto/306681/o-cachorrinho-samba-colecao-cachorrinho-samba/"&gt;O Cachorrinho
Samba&lt;/a&gt;
da &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Jos%C3%A9_Dupr%C3%A9"&gt;Maria José
Dupré&lt;/a&gt;:
Este foi o primeiro livro que eu lí sozinho, ou seja, não foram meus
pais que leram para mim. Por algum motivo que eu ainda não consigo
explicar, o cachorrinho Samba tomou controle completo da minha
imaginação, e depois dele eu simplesmente devorei todos os outros
livros da série do cachorrinho Samba e os outros da Maria José Dupré,
como &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.livrariasaraiva.com.br/produto/306678/a-mina-de-ouro-colecao-cachorrinho-samba/"&gt;A Mina de
Ouro&lt;/a&gt;
e &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.livrariasaraiva.com.br/produto/316496/a-montanha-encantada-col-cachorrinho-samba/"&gt;A Montanha
Encantanda&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9rie_Vaga-Lume"&gt;Série
Vaga-Lume&lt;/a&gt;:
Não tem como eu falar sobre livros e minha infância sem falar sobre
esta coleção de livros! Não me lembro dos detalhes de como que os
livros foram publicados, se foi um novo a cada semana, etc, mas só
sei que entre minhas irmãs e eu, nós provavelmente lemos quase todos
os livros que apareceram na nossa frente! Mais uma vez, se não fosse
pela Dona Maria Teresa, eu não teria visto &lt;strong&gt;“A Ilha Perdida”, “A
Turma da Rua Quinze”, “Aventuras de Xisto”, “Coração de Onça”,
“Menino de Asas”, “O Escaravelho do Diabo”&lt;/strong&gt;, para mencionar alguns!
A &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Lista_de_volumes_da_cole%C3%A7%C3%A3o_Vaga-Lume"&gt;lista completa dos
livros&lt;/a&gt;
eu deixo aqui para quem estiver interessado.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monteiro_Lobato"&gt;Monteiro Lobato&lt;/a&gt;:
Provavelmente a maior influência entre todos os livros e autores que
eu já lí, os livros do &lt;strong&gt;Monteiro Lobato&lt;/strong&gt; foram os que eu mais lí,
re-lí, e viví na minha infância! Quem me conhece dos tempos onde eu
morava em &lt;strong&gt;São Franciso, MG&lt;/strong&gt;, sabem muito bem como que passei horas
&lt;strong&gt;tentando capturar o Sací&lt;/strong&gt; da mesma forma que o &lt;strong&gt;Pedrinho&lt;/strong&gt;
tentou, ou usava pó de perlim-pim-pim para me imaginar viajando para
paises e mundos distantes! Só sei que eu queria ser um escritor,
igual Monteiro Lobato quando crescer! ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BAlio_Verne"&gt;Júlio Verne&lt;/a&gt;:
Mais um autor que me fez companhia durante a infância! Não sei
exatamente quantos de seus livros eu lí no total, mas dentre eles o
que eu mais curtí foi um chamado “&lt;strong&gt;Dois Anos de Férias&lt;/strong&gt;”!
Infelizmente, quando eu me mudei do Brasil para os Estados Unidos em
1991, tive de vender ou doar todas as minhas coisas, e dentre elas,
minha coleção encadernada do Júlio Verne.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tio_Patinhas"&gt;Tio Patinhas&lt;/a&gt;: Tudo
bem que revistinha em quadrinho (ou você chama isso de gibí?) não é
livro, mas aqueles almanaques do Tio Patinhas que saiam de vez em
quando com histórias quilométricas com o &lt;strong&gt;Pato Donald&lt;/strong&gt; e seus
sobrinhos, se metendo em aventuras prá lá de malucas foram fonte de
muita inspiração quando pequeno!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_do_Escoteiro-Mirim_(Editora_Abril)"&gt;Manual do
Escoteiro-Mirim&lt;/a&gt;:
Ainda falando sobre revistinhas e tal, a Disney lançou o Manual do
Escoteiro-Mirim, e eu ia na casa do &lt;strong&gt;Márlon&lt;/strong&gt; (amigo da minha irmã
mais nova) quase todos os domingos só para sentar na cadeira de
balanço que tinha na varanda dele e passar horas lendo e tentando
aprender tudo o que eu podia sobre a arte de ser um escoteiro! Foi
por causa deste livro que eu acabei entrando nos “&lt;strong&gt;Lobinhos&lt;/strong&gt;” e
depois nos &lt;strong&gt;Escoteiros&lt;/strong&gt; lá em São Francisco, MG (“Patrulha do
Touro”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homero"&gt;Homero&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp; Lá na casa do
&lt;strong&gt;Márlon&lt;/strong&gt; também tinham livros que atraíram minha curiosidade, e
depois de ler sobre “&lt;strong&gt;Os 12 Trabalhos de Hércules&lt;/strong&gt;” com o
Monteiro Lobato, fiquei mais que apaixonado pelas aventuras descritas
no “&lt;strong&gt;A Odisséia&lt;/strong&gt;” e “&lt;strong&gt;A Ilíada&lt;/strong&gt;” de &lt;strong&gt;Homero&lt;/strong&gt;! Desde
então eu lí vários livros sobre mitologia grega, mas foi com Homero
que eu peguei o gostinho por este tópico!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naufrágio&lt;/strong&gt;: Da mesma forma que mitologia grega me atraia quando
pequeno, livros sobre naufrágios foi mais uma categoria que mecheu
muito com a minha imaginação. “&lt;strong&gt;A Ilha do Tesouro&lt;/strong&gt;” de &lt;strong&gt;Robert
Louis Stevenson&lt;/strong&gt; (que por sinal foi o primeiro livro que eu lí no
Clube do Livro na terceira série), “&lt;strong&gt;Os Robinsons Suiços&lt;/strong&gt;” de
&lt;strong&gt;Johan David Wyss&lt;/strong&gt;, “&lt;strong&gt;As Viagens de Gulliver&lt;/strong&gt;” de &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan
Swift&lt;/strong&gt;, “&lt;strong&gt;Robinson Crusoé&lt;/strong&gt;” de &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Dafoe&lt;/strong&gt;, e vários
livros do Júlio Verne foram alguns dos livros que eu lí muito (e me
fizeram secretamente desejar que eu també ficasse naufragado em uma
ílha deserta, onde eu pudesse usar todos aqueles truques que eu
aprendi no “Manual do Escoteiro-Mirim”)!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Os Meninos da Rua Paulo&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp; Este livro do &lt;strong&gt;Ferenc Molnár&lt;/strong&gt; foi
fonte de inspiração para a criação do meu primeiro clube, “&lt;strong&gt;Os
Brasinhas&lt;/strong&gt;”, e da minha primeira “guerra” contra o clube
adversário para capturar sua bandeira! Foi um dia de muita aventura,
adrenalina, pedrada e mamona verde nas costas, mas isso é assunto
para outro dia! “&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Os_Meninos_da_Rua_Paulo"&gt;Os Meninos da Rua
Paulo&lt;/a&gt;” é
um dos poucos livros da minha infância que eu adoraria ter comigo,
mas infelizmente ainda está falntando na minha coleção…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tex Willer, Ken Parker, Zagor&lt;/strong&gt;, e &lt;strong&gt;Asterix&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp; Fechando meu Top
10 não podia faltar estes personagens do mundo de aventuras dos
quadrinhos! Foi com o Tex, Ken, Zagor e Asterix e amigos que eu
aprendi bastante sobre cowboys, velho oeste, legião romana, e um
pouco da geografia dos Estados Unidos e Europa Ocidental! Já cheguei
a ter mais de 600 revistas destes personagens, mas infelizmente
também tive de me desfazer delas na “grande mudança” para os Estados
Unidos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ao compilar esta lista vários outros autores e livros também vieram à
tona, mas como o objetivo era manter tudo em uma lista com 10 entradas,
não coloquei &lt;strong&gt;Isaac Asimov&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Tolkien&lt;/strong&gt;, “&lt;strong&gt;Memórias de Um Cabo de
Vassoura&lt;/strong&gt;”, &lt;strong&gt;Mark Twain&lt;/strong&gt;, dentre outros. Até mesmo a série do
&lt;strong&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/strong&gt; já faz parte dos meus livros favoritos, mas eu acho que
os que eu listei neste post foram realmente os que mais me marcaram e,
de uma forma, moldaram a minha vida!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bem, é isso aí! Desejo a todos vocês um excelente final de ano, e um
maravilhoso 2012! Depois eu volto para contar o meu Top 10 de músicas e
filmes! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olá pessoal e seja muito bem-vindo à este episódio de natal (e o último
de 2011)! Dando continuidade à proposta de trazer mais uma entrevista
com uma personalidade do &lt;strong&gt;Conectiva Linux&lt;/strong&gt;, desta vez tenho o prazer
de apresentar a vocês o &lt;strong&gt;Rodrigo Novo&lt;/strong&gt;! Durante nosso bate-papo ele
conta como que largou a faculdade para entrar no Conectiva Linux em
1997, trabalhando com o &lt;strong&gt;Aurélio “verde” Jargas&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Marcelo Tosatti&lt;/strong&gt;,
entre outros na área de suporte, como que ele “graduou” para a equipe da
distribuição, &lt;strong&gt;KDE 0.11&lt;/strong&gt;, a história do “&lt;strong&gt;easter egg&lt;/strong&gt;” que nunca
foi publicado, onde será a próxima “&lt;strong&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/strong&gt;” brasileira,
e seu interesse por &lt;strong&gt;poker&lt;/strong&gt; e &lt;strong&gt;filmes clássicos&lt;/strong&gt;!&amp;nbsp; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/rodrigo-novo-conectiva-linux"&gt;Escute

&lt;p&gt;O entrevistado deste episódio é o &lt;strong&gt;João Fernando Costa Junior&lt;/strong&gt;,
criador e mantenedor da &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.revista.espiritolivre.org/"&gt;Revista Espírito
Livre&lt;/a&gt;, “uma publicação em
formato digital, a ser distribuída em PDF, gratuita e com foco em
tecnologia, cultura livre, Internet, sempre tendo como plano de fundo o
iniciativas como o software livre.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durante o nosso bate-papo, tive a oportunidade de aprender sobre como
que o projeto foi iniciado, o seu objetivo, e perguntei tudo aquilo que
você sempre quiz saber sobre a revista, mas tinha medo de perguntar! O
João relata como é o dia-a-dia no processo da criação de cada edição,
quais as ferramentas usadas, quantas pessoas participam, e seus planos
para o futuro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Também conversamos sobre a realização do &lt;strong&gt;1º Fórum Espírito Livre&lt;/strong&gt; que
aconteceu em Novembro na cidade de Vitória, ES, sobre o “exemplar raro”,
e até mesmo um ovo de páscoa para a próxima edição!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dando continuidade ao plano de trazer mais uma entrevista com um membro
do Conectiva Linux, desta vez conversei com o &lt;strong&gt;Rudá Moura&lt;/strong&gt; que
trabalhou na área de suporte e empacotamento da distribuição! Durante o
nosso bate-papo conversamos sobre como que entrar no &lt;strong&gt;Conectiva Linux&lt;/strong&gt;
foi para ele aquela famosa frase “&lt;strong&gt;estar no local certo, na hora
certa&lt;/strong&gt;!” Também falamos sobre como o Conectiva foi o equivalente da
“&lt;strong&gt;Canonical Brasileira&lt;/strong&gt;”, problemas comuns de suporte dos usuários
e o mantra “&lt;strong&gt;Use o X Configurator&lt;/strong&gt;”, as &lt;strong&gt;críticas&lt;/strong&gt; que sofreram
dos usuários brasileiros, &lt;strong&gt;rock stars&lt;/strong&gt;, dia a dia no escritório. &lt;strong&gt;os
manobristas de garagem&lt;/strong&gt; e, é claro, o seu &lt;strong&gt;Top 5&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

longo das próximas semanas vou tentar entrevistar um membro desta
distribuição que foi tão importante nos primeiros anos de internet no
Brasil, e publicar um novo episódio fora da agenda, assim que sair do
forno!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para dar o pontapé inicial, bati um papo com o &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://epx.com.br/"&gt;Elvis
Pfutzenreuter&lt;/a&gt;, que trabalhou inicialmente como
documentador e depois mantenedor nos primeiros anos de 2000. Durante

&lt;p&gt;Last October I celebrated a couple of milestones in my life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 years&lt;/strong&gt; living in &lt;strong&gt;North Carolina&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 years&lt;/strong&gt; since I bought my &lt;strong&gt;first house&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 years&lt;/strong&gt; married to &lt;strong&gt;my wife&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 years&lt;/strong&gt; working for &lt;strong&gt;rPath&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, each one of those milestones were very important to me
as they mark important decision points in my life! Every single one of
them changed my life for the better and I can’t help but feel blessed
that I have so many things to look forward to at end of the year that
remind me how lucky I have been!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week was my also an important day for me, as I was offered and
accepted a job to work at &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt; as a &lt;strong&gt;Senior QA Engineer&lt;/strong&gt; for
their &lt;strong&gt;CloudForms&lt;/strong&gt; team! I assure you that it was a bitter sweet
moment for me, for a really loved the work I had been doing at rPath.
But the chance to work on Red Hat’s cloud initiative was too much of a
temptation for me to pass! I have been truly blessed for having had the
chance to join rPath 5 years ago at a point where they were still trying
to establish themselves among the big technology providers out there.
Five years later they’ve accomplished their goal and I can look back and
feel proud that all the late nights, cancelled vacations and hard work
paid off!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This December I get to work on a very exciting project with a great
bunch of guys trying to accomplish a similar task! I am extremely
excited about the potential that CloudForms and its derivatives will
bring to the masses and I can only hope to be able to look back five

&lt;p&gt;Outubro do ano passado eu comemorei alguns marcos na minha vida:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 anos&lt;/strong&gt; morando na &lt;strong&gt;Carolina do Norte&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 anos&lt;/strong&gt; desde que eu comprei minha &lt;strong&gt;primeira casa&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 anos casado&lt;/strong&gt; com &lt;strong&gt;minha esposa&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 anos&lt;/strong&gt; trabalhando para &lt;strong&gt;rPath;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Te garanto que cada um desses marcos foram muito importantes para mim,
já que marcam decisões importante na minha vida! Cada um deles mudou a
minha vida para melhor e eu me sinto abençoado por ter tantas coisas
para celebrar no final do ano que me fazem lembrar o quão sortudo eu
tenho sido!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na semana passada foi um dia importante para mim, pois fui oferecido e
aceitei uma oferta de trabalho na &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt; como &lt;strong&gt;Engenheiro Senior
de QA&lt;/strong&gt; para a sua equipe &lt;strong&gt;CloudForms&lt;/strong&gt;! Garanto a vocês que foi um
momento alegre e triste ao mesmo tempo para mim: por um lado um
realmente adorava o trabalho que eu vinha fazendo no rPath. Mas a chance
de trabalhar na iniciativa de clouds da Red Hat foi uma tentação difícil
de passar! Eu tenho sido verdadeiramente abençoado por ter tido a chance
de me juntar à rPath 5 anos atrás em um ponto onde eles ainda estavam
tentando se estabelecer entre os grandes fornecedores de tecnologia lá
fora. Cinco anos depois eles conseguiram seu objetivo e eu posso olhar
para trás e sentir orgulho de todos os longo dias, as férias canceladas
e todo o trabalho duro que valeu a pena!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Em dezembro eu começo a trabalhar em um projeto muito emocionante com um
grupo de pessoas prá lá de inteligente tentando realizar uma tarefa
similar! Estou extremamente animado com o potencial que CloudForms e
seus derivados vão trazer para as massas e eu só espero ser capaz de
olhar para trás daqui a cinco anos e ser capaz de celebrar mais um
trabalho bem feito!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Infinity, and Beyond!&lt;/p&gt;

Programmer&lt;/strong&gt; trabalhando para a &lt;strong&gt;Asobo Studio&lt;/strong&gt; em &lt;strong&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/strong&gt;, na
&lt;strong&gt;França&lt;/strong&gt; em um projeto que ainda não foi anunciado para um console
next generation. Durante os 60 minutos que batemos papo, conversamos
sobre sua experiência vivendo com somente 550 euros por semana na
&lt;strong&gt;Alemanha&lt;/strong&gt;, como começou sua carrera em companhias de jogos, vivendo
em &lt;strong&gt;Israel&lt;/strong&gt; com um &lt;strong&gt;chefe Russo&lt;/strong&gt;, se perdendo na &lt;strong&gt;Palestina&lt;/strong&gt;,

&lt;p&gt;Olá pessoal! Foi com um enorme pezar que eu recebi a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sejalivre.org/?p=5698"&gt;notícia&lt;/a&gt; sobre o falecimento de &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://andregondim.eti.br/"&gt;André
Gondim&lt;/a&gt;, uma figura do software livre
Brasileiro que, infelizmente, nos deixou na semana passada… O meu
relacionamento com o André começou em 2005 quando eu ainda administrava
a equipe de traduções do &lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu Brasil&lt;/strong&gt;. Assim como o &lt;strong&gt;Fábio
Nogueira&lt;/strong&gt; e &lt;strong&gt;André Noel&lt;/strong&gt;, pessoas que eventualmente também ocuparam o
cardo de coordenador desta equipe, o André Gondim foi uma das pessoas
com quem eu tive o prazer de trabalhar e instruir no processo de
traduções. Durante o nosso dia-a-dia, vi o trabalho e dedicação que ele
sempre trazia e pude acompanhar o seu desenvolvimento e crescimento
dentro da equipe. Mesmo depois que eu parei de contribuir com o Ubuntu e
parti para traduções para o &lt;strong&gt;GNOME&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Xfce&lt;/strong&gt; e &lt;strong&gt;LXDE&lt;/strong&gt;, com a ajuda
do André foi possível sincronizar o trabalho entre as equipes e assim
garantir que o Ubuntu tivesse uma tradução de qualidade e ao mesmo tempo
respeitar o trabalho dos tradutores das equipes GNOME, etc, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://andregondim.eti.br/"&gt;http://andregondim.eti.br/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/#!/AndreGondim"&gt;https://twitter.com/#!/AndreGondim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://andregondim.eti.br/"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://identi.ca/andregondim"&gt;http://identi.ca/andregondim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;:
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/andregondim?ref=ts"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/andregondim?ref=ts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O André foi um usuário ativo em várias comunidades e sempre presente no
canal &lt;strong&gt;#tradutores&lt;/strong&gt; da rede freenode onde muitos dos tradutores
brasileiros de software livre se encontram para trocar idéias, sugestões
e bater papo…. Na sexta-feira, dia 4 de novembro, seu usário ainda
estava presente no canal… O André será sempre lembrado no canal dos
tradutores, assim como o &lt;strong&gt;Rafael Higino&lt;/strong&gt;, como uma pessoa que estava
sempre disposta a ajudar quem quer que fosse, sempre com entusiasmo,
cordialidade e boa vontade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screenshot.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Usuário do André no canal dos tradutores" src="http://www.castalio.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screenshot-300x124.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apesar de ter conversado com ele muitas vezes nos últimos anos, eu
infelizmente não tive a oportunidade de conhecê-lo pessoalmente. Durante
o evento &lt;strong&gt;FISL&lt;/strong&gt; desde ano ele tinha me convidado para ficar em sua
casa, já que eu estava programado para participar do evento, mas devido
à mudanças na minha vida pessoal, tive de cancelar a minha ida ao
Brasil. Mas tenho certeza que um dia ei de encontrá-lo e poderemos então
finalmente nos conhecer e colocar o papo em dia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anuncio aqui então que tanto o &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://planeta.gnulinuxbrasil.org/"&gt;Planeta GNU/Linux
Brasil&lt;/a&gt; quanto o&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/"&gt;Castálio
Podcast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;estão de luto até o final do
ano&lt;/strong&gt;! Também foi publicado um &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/episodio-especial-andre-gondim-ubuntu-brasil/"&gt;episódio
especial&lt;/a&gt;
no podcast, como minha homenagem ao &lt;strong&gt;André Gondim, um símbolo de força
de vontade, coragem e um super tradutor brasileiro&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatos:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Membro do &lt;strong&gt;Launchpad&lt;/strong&gt; desde &lt;strong&gt;setembro 12, 2005&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu Member&lt;/strong&gt; desde &lt;strong&gt;fevereiro 03, 2008&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8,250&lt;/strong&gt; contribuições de tradução para o Ubuntu pelo &lt;strong&gt;Rosetta&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;66&lt;/strong&gt; contribuições de tradução para o &lt;strong&gt;GNOME&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O convidado de hoje é o &lt;strong&gt;Guilherme Salgado&lt;/strong&gt;. Durante nosso bate-papo,
conversamos sobre como que ele começou a usar computadores e &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt;,
sobre sua passagem pela companhia &lt;strong&gt;ASync&lt;/strong&gt; e trabalhando no
&lt;strong&gt;Launchpad&lt;/strong&gt;, e sua ida para a &lt;strong&gt;Canonical&lt;/strong&gt;, a companhia por trás da
distribuição &lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu Linux&lt;/strong&gt;! Também conversamos sobre o trabalho que
ele tem feito na Linaro para melhorar e facilitar o desenvolvimento em
dispositivos&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ARM&lt;/strong&gt;, sobre &lt;strong&gt;integração contínua&lt;/strong&gt;, suas aventuras no
mundo de &lt;strong&gt;bodyboarding&lt;/strong&gt;, nova experiência vivendo na &lt;strong&gt;Argentina&lt;/strong&gt; e
sobre as criticas que a Canonical tem sofrido nos últimos anos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No episódio de hoje vocês vão ter a oportunidade de conhecer um pouco
melhor o &lt;strong&gt;Evandro Pastor&lt;/strong&gt;, co-fundador deste podcast e amigo de guerra
de vários anos! Vocês vão aprender sobre como nasceu a sua companhia de
web design, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.quartoestudio.com/web/"&gt;Quarto Estudio&lt;/a&gt;,
sobre o tempo que ele passou trabalhando no &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Parque-do-Gugu/143888722341418"&gt;parque de diversões do
Gugu&lt;/a&gt;,
o que ele pensa sobre os &lt;strong&gt;cursos de web design no Brasil&lt;/strong&gt;, sua paixão
por video games, sua mudança para o interiorrrr de São Paulo e o começo
de seu Plano C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Este foi sem sombra de dúvidas a entrevista mais divertida que eu fiz
até agora, provavelmente devido ao nível da intimidade que tenho com o
Evandro e de poder fazer perguntas com um pouco de irreverência. A
entrevista toda foi mais de 1 hora de um bate-papo super divertido, mas
tive de cortar algumas partes para que não virasse uma maratona para
vocês. O Evandro é super divertido e é impossível falar com ele sem
rolar de rir e eu realmente espero que vocês gostem deste
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/evandro-pastor-quarto-estudio/"&gt;episódio&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Em um dia de muita chuva em Florianópolis, SC finalmente consegui bater
um bom papo com o &lt;strong&gt;Augusto Campos&lt;/strong&gt;, fundador dos super populares&amp;nbsp;sites
&lt;strong&gt;BR-Linux&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;BR-Mac&lt;/strong&gt; e &lt;strong&gt;Efetividade&lt;/strong&gt;! Devido à conexão que estava
sofrendo muita perda de pacotes (&lt;strong&gt;para cada 7 minutos de áudio, passei
60 minutos editando&lt;/strong&gt;), mantivemos nossa entrevista por apenas 34
minutos, mas mesmo assim deu tempo para discutirmos sobre a criação dos
web sites, as mudanças que aconteceram durante os anos, sobre a
entrevista com &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hacktoon.com/?s=augusto+campos"&gt;GTalk Show&lt;/a&gt; do
&lt;strong&gt;Karlisson&lt;/strong&gt;, o mercado de trabalho em Santa Catarina, suas ferramentas
de trabalho, livros, filmes e música. Uma novidade que também tenho é a
participação mais que especial do &lt;strong&gt;Evandro Pastor&lt;/strong&gt;, que literalmente
&lt;strong&gt;casou, mudou e não me convidou&lt;/strong&gt;! :) Mas ele já está bem melhor e quem
sabe não volta no próximo episódio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who follow my many different projects and enterprises, you
probably already know that I have been hosting a podcast called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/"&gt;Castálio Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, a bi-weekly show where
I interview people from the &lt;strong&gt;Brazilian FOSS&lt;/strong&gt; world and talk about
their likes, dislikes and what events and factors shaped their lives!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked my listeners if they would be interested in an episode in
English with someone new and exciting, the answer was an overwhelming
‘&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for my very first episode in English I chose to interview a good
friend of mine from several years:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Pete Savage&lt;/strong&gt;! During the next 58
minutes we talked about how we first met through a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;PyGtk&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;video he
posted a while back during a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Linux User Group&lt;/strong&gt;meeting, how he
first got involved with&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Edubuntu&lt;/strong&gt;, and then moved on to several
other projects such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ProgBox&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;GeekDeck&lt;/strong&gt;, about the books
that he’s written including the reason for writing “&lt;strong&gt;Emblem
Divide&lt;/strong&gt;”, how much the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Japanese culture&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;plays a role in his
daily life, and his&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Top 5&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;movies, books and movies! While the
episodes’ in English future are yet to be determined, this latest
episode can be downloaded

&lt;p&gt;Como prometido aos ouvintes do &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.castalio.info/"&gt;Castálio
Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, eu gostária de anunciar o
&lt;strong&gt;primeiro episódio completamente em inglês&lt;/strong&gt;!!! O convidado deste
episódio é Pete Savage, amigo de alguns anos que começou sua empreitada
no mundo do software livre pelo projeto Edubuntu, criador de vários
programas de notícias como o &lt;strong&gt;ProgBox&lt;/strong&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://geekdeck.wordpress.com/"&gt;GeekDeck&lt;/a&gt;, e escritor de alguns
livros, como “&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://emblemdivide.com/"&gt;Emblem Divide&lt;/a&gt;” e “Git
In The Trenches”. Durante 58 minutos conversamos sobre sua evolução pelo
mundo do &lt;strong&gt;software livre&lt;/strong&gt;, sobre o processo de escrever livros de
ficção e educacionais, e sobre o papel que a &lt;strong&gt;cultura japonesa&lt;/strong&gt; tem no
seu dia a dia! Para os ouvintes que não se sentem confortáveis com o
inglês, use o &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://translate.google.com/"&gt;serviço&lt;/a&gt; de traduções do

&lt;p&gt;I rebuilt the appliance to use the latest &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2011/sep/09/security-releases-issued/"&gt;Django 1.3.1
release&lt;/a&gt;
to deliver the &lt;strong&gt;security fixes&lt;/strong&gt; found in the previous version. There
are also several other updated packages included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to play with this appliance, feel free to download it in the

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Raw Filesystem images, here’s how I currently use it &amp;nbsp;with
&lt;strong&gt;QEMU&lt;/strong&gt;. In my &lt;strong&gt;.bashrc&lt;/strong&gt; file I have an alias that will boot them and
redirect it’s internal ports &lt;strong&gt;80&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;22&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;apache&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ssh&lt;/strong&gt;)
to my system’s port &lt;strong&gt;8080&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;2222&lt;/strong&gt; respectively. I also forward
port &lt;strong&gt;3389&lt;/strong&gt; for Windows systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sudo &lt;span class="pre"&gt;qemu-kvm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; 2048 &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-hda&lt;/span&gt; &amp;quot;$1&amp;quot; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-boot&lt;/span&gt; c &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-soundhw&lt;/span&gt; ac97 &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-redir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;tcp:8080::80&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-redir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;tcp:2222::22&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-redir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;tcp:9999::3389&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I call my alias and pass a raw filesystem image as an argument,
I can then use &lt;strong&gt;localhost&lt;/strong&gt; as the destination to my http and ssh
connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a special configuration in my &lt;strong&gt;.ssh/config&lt;/strong&gt; file to make
it easier for me to ssh to these virtual systems and not have to change
my &lt;strong&gt;known_hosts&lt;/strong&gt; file every time I boot a different system and try to
ssh to localhost on port 2222:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home"&gt;2011 Open Source
Awards&lt;/a&gt; was launched
on the 1st week of August by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.packtpub.com/"&gt;Packt&lt;/a&gt;,
inviting people to submit nominations for their &lt;strong&gt;favorite Open Source
project&lt;/strong&gt;. Now in its sixth year, the Awards continue in its aim of
encouraging, supporting, recognizing and rewarding all Open Source
projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;2010 Open Source Award Winners&lt;/strong&gt; included the Open Source
&lt;strong&gt;Content Management System (CMS)&lt;/strong&gt; Award winner &lt;strong&gt;CMS Made Simple&lt;/strong&gt;,
Open Source &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript Libraries&lt;/strong&gt; Award winner &lt;strong&gt;jQuery&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;Pimcore&lt;/strong&gt; the winner of the &lt;strong&gt;Most Promising Open Source Project
Award&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2011 Awards will feature a &lt;strong&gt;prize fund of $24,000&lt;/strong&gt; with several
new categories introduced and the vote of the public becoming more
influential. This year all CMS projects will compete in an even tighter
contest in the Open Source CMS Award category with the now defunct Hall
of Fame CMS finalists re-entered into the CMS category. Projects such as
&lt;strong&gt;Drupal&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Joomla&lt;/strong&gt;! will face off with &lt;strong&gt;CMS Made Simple&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;MODx&lt;/strong&gt; for the first time since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Most Promising Open Source Project and the Open Source
JavaScript Libraries categories will be back for a second year, Packt is
introducing &lt;strong&gt;new categories&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;Open Source Business
Applications&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Open Source Multimedia Software&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Open Source
Mobile Toolkit and Libraries&lt;/strong&gt;. These new categories will ensure that
the Open Source Awards remain committed to providing the platform to
recognise excellence within the community while supporting Open Source
projects both new and old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We’ve managed to continue to provide new levels of accessibility for
Open Source projects, while encouraging a more competitive nature in the
contest by increasing the public votes influence. Additionally, we
thought it would be a great idea to reward more projects thus we’ve
introduced sub-category awards across a number of the categories during
the voting stage. We expect the Awards this year to be bigger and
better.”&lt;/em&gt; said &lt;strong&gt;Julian Copes&lt;/strong&gt;, organizer of this year’s Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packt has opened up nominations for people to submit their favorite Open
Source projects for each category at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.PacktPub.com/open-source-awards-home"&gt;www.PacktPub.com/open-source-awards-home&lt;/a&gt;
. The top five in each category will go through to the final, which
begins mid-September. For more information on the categories, read
Packt’s recent announcement:

&lt;p&gt;Having bought books from them before, I’m very happy to support their
initiative and invite the readers to not only participate of this event
but check out their books and EBooks as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No episódio de hoje conversei com o &lt;strong&gt;Álvaro “Turicas” Justen&lt;/strong&gt; sobre um
monte de coisas relacionadas ao &lt;strong&gt;Arduino&lt;/strong&gt;, e como usá-lo junto com
vários outros adaptadores (&lt;strong&gt;shields&lt;/strong&gt;) para fazer um monte de coisas
bacanas, como &lt;strong&gt;controlar a cor de um abajour pelo seu telefone
Android&lt;/strong&gt; e usar uma &lt;strong&gt;guitarra para jogar Frets on Fire&lt;/strong&gt;! Também
falamos do &lt;strong&gt;Turiquinhas&lt;/strong&gt;, o &lt;strong&gt;carro controlado por luz&lt;/strong&gt; cheio de
firulas que ele desenvolveu junto com uns amigos. Depois que terminamos
a entrevista, ele também me contou sobre o
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://GitHub.com/turicas/tweetlamp"&gt;TweetLamp&lt;/a&gt;, uma forma super
interessante de controlar uma lâmpada pelo Twitter! É só mandar uma
mensagem “lâmpada &lt;strong&gt;on&lt;/strong&gt;” que o arduino liga a lâmpada, e “lâmpada
&lt;strong&gt;off&lt;/strong&gt;” para desligá-la! Falamos de sua participação no &lt;strong&gt;FISL
2011&lt;/strong&gt;, sobre sua viagem à &lt;strong&gt;Bolivia&lt;/strong&gt;, terminando com o seu &lt;strong&gt;Top 5&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O entrevistado desta vez é o português &lt;strong&gt;Carlos Ribeiro&lt;/strong&gt;, desenvolvedor
do projeto &lt;strong&gt;RadioTray&lt;/strong&gt;, um programa bem leve e simples para escutar
estações de rádio online. Durante nosso bate-papo conversamos sobre a
criação e o crescimento de seu projeto, sobre aprendendo a programar com
&lt;strong&gt;python&lt;/strong&gt;, como o &lt;strong&gt;software livre&lt;/strong&gt; é visto em &lt;strong&gt;Portugal&lt;/strong&gt;, a falta
de livros técnicos em português em Portugal e o seu &lt;strong&gt;Top 5&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

conversamos sobre sua história pelo Arch, alguns dos seus projetos de
segurança e alerta de atualizações, e como que ele deixou de querer ser
um&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;hacker&lt;/strong&gt;, invadir a &lt;strong&gt;NASA&lt;/strong&gt; e &lt;strong&gt;FBI&lt;/strong&gt;, e acabou se

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Openbox 3.5.0&lt;/strong&gt; was
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://openbox.org/wiki/Openbox:Changelog"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, and
with it several bugs got fixed and a few new features were added. Out of
these features the one that I liked most was the ability to add &lt;strong&gt;icons
to menus&lt;/strong&gt; (and submenus as well)! Yeah, I know some other managers
already do this but for someone who enjoys running Openbox because of
its simplicity and keyboard binding limitless possibilities, I was sure
glad to see some eye candy make its way to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you want to try it, make sure that your distribution has the new
Openbox compiled with Imlib2. Next, add the following line to the
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;menu&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; section of your &lt;strong&gt;*rc.xml*&lt;/strong&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;showIcons&amp;gt;yes&amp;lt;/showIcons&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, modify your &lt;strong&gt;*menu.xml*&lt;/strong&gt; by adding an icon attribute to what
ever menu item or menu you want to add an icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
&amp;lt;menu id=&amp;quot;apps-net-menu&amp;quot; icon=&amp;quot;/usr/share/icons/Tango/24x24/apps/internet-web-browser.png&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;menu id=&amp;quot;apps-net-menu&amp;quot; label=&amp;quot;Internet&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;menu id=&amp;quot;apps-net-browsers&amp;quot; label=&amp;quot;Browsers&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;item label=&amp;quot;Firefox&amp;quot; icon=&amp;quot;/usr/share/icons/hicolor/24x24/apps/firefox.png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;action name=&amp;quot;Execute&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;firefox&amp;lt;/command&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;startupnotify&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;enabled&amp;gt;yes&amp;lt;/enabled&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;wmclass&amp;gt;Firefox&amp;lt;/wmclass&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/startupnotify&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/action&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/item&amp;gt;
        .
        .
        .
&amp;lt;/menu&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to restart openbox and enjoy your fancy new menu!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Openbox 3.5.0&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;foi
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://openbox.org/wiki/Openbox:Changelog"&gt;lançado&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;ontem, e com ele
vários problemas (bugs) foram resolvidos e alguns novos recursos foram
adicionados. Dentre estes novos recursos, o que eu gostei mais foi poder
adicionar &lt;strong&gt;ícones aos menus&lt;/strong&gt; (e submenus também)! Tá, eu sei que
outros gerenciadores fazem isso, mas para alguém que como eu curto o
Openbox por sua simplicidade e possibilidades ilimitadas de atalhos de
teclado, eu fiquei super empolgado de ver um pouco de “eye candy” ser
adicionado ao projeto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Então, se você estiver interessado em experimentar isso, certifique-se
que sua distribuição já atualizou o Openbox e que ele foi compilado
com&lt;strong&gt;Imlib2&lt;/strong&gt;. Aí, adicione a seguinte linha na seção&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;menu&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; do
seu arquivo&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;*rc.xml*&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;lt;showIcons&amp;gt;yes&amp;lt;/showIcons&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depois é modificar o seu arquivo &lt;strong&gt;*menu.xml*&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;à gosto, adicionando um
atributo &lt;strong&gt;icon&lt;/strong&gt; no ítem de menu ou menu desejado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
&amp;lt;menu id=&amp;quot;apps-net-menu&amp;quot; icon=&amp;quot;/usr/share/icons/Tango/24x24/apps/internet-web-browser.png&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;menu id=&amp;quot;apps-net-menu&amp;quot; label=&amp;quot;Internet&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;menu id=&amp;quot;apps-net-browsers&amp;quot; label=&amp;quot;Browsers&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;item label=&amp;quot;Firefox&amp;quot; icon=&amp;quot;/usr/share/icons/hicolor/24x24/apps/firefox.png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;action name=&amp;quot;Execute&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;firefox&amp;lt;/command&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;startupnotify&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;enabled&amp;gt;yes&amp;lt;/enabled&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;wmclass&amp;gt;Firefox&amp;lt;/wmclass&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/startupnotify&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/action&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/item&amp;gt;
        .
        .
        .
&amp;lt;/menu&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lembre-se de re-iniciar o openbox e curta o seu novo menu!&lt;/p&gt;

desenvolvedores para implementação de acessibilidade.&lt;/p&gt;
