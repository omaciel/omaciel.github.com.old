<p>This <strong>July 2015</strong> I travelled to the <strong>Red Hat</strong> office in <strong>Brno, Czech Republic</strong> to spend some time with my teammates there, and I managed to get a lot of reading done between long plane rides and being jet lagged for many nights :) So I finally managed to finish up some of the books that had been lingering on my <em>ToDo</em> list and even managed to finally read a few of the books that together make up the <strong>Chronicles of Narnia</strong>, since I had never read them as a kid.</p>

<p>Out of all the books I read this month, I feel that <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=All+Quiet+on+the+Western+Front">All Quiet on the Western Front</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=The+October+Country">The October Country</a> were the ones I enjoyed reading the most, closely followed by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Cryptonomicon">Cryptonomicon</a>, which took me a while to get through. The other books, with the exception of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=The+Memoirs+of+Sherlock+Holmes">The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</a>, helped me pass the time when I only wanted to be entertained.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=All+Quiet+on+the+Western+Front">All Quiet on the Western Front</a> takes the prize for being one of the best books I have ever read! I felt that the way <strong>WWI</strong> was presented through the eyes of the main character was a great way to represent all the pain, angst and suffering that all sides of conflict went through, without catering for any particular side or having an agenda. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Erich+Maria+Remarque">Erich Maria Remarque</a>'s style had me some times breathless, some times with a knot on the pit of my stomach I as 'endured' the many life changing events that took place in the book. Is this an action-packed book about WWI? Will it read like a thriller? In my opinion, even though there are many chapters with gory details about killings and battles, the answer is a very bland 'maybe'. I think that the real 'star' of this book is its philosophical view of the war and how the main characters, all around 19-20 years of age, learn to deal with its life lasting effects.</p>
<p>Now, I have been a huge fan of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Ray+Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> for a while now, and when I got <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=The+October+Country">The October Country</a> for my birthday last month, I just knew that it would be time well spent reading it. For those of you who are more acquainted his science fiction works, this book will surprise you as it shows you a bit of  his 'darker' side. All of the short stories included in this collection deal with death, mysterious apparitions, inexplicable endings and are sure to spook you a little bit.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Cryptonomicon">Cryptonomicon</a> was at times slow, some other times funny and, especially toward the end, a very entertaining book. Weighing in at a hefty 1000 pages (depending on the edition you have, plus/minus 50 odd pages), this book covers two different periods in the lives of a number of different characters, past (around <strong>WWII</strong>) and present, all different threads eventually leading to a great finale. Alternating between past and present, the story takes us to the early days of how <strong>cryptology</strong> was 'officially invented' and used during the war, and how many of the events that took place back then were affecting the lives of some of the direct descendants of the main characters in our present day. As you go through the back and forth you start to gather bits and pieces of information that eventually connects all the dots of an interesting puzzle. It definitely requires a long term commitment to go though it, but it was enjoyable and, as I mention before, it made me laugh at many places.</p>

<p>Those of you who know me know that I am a huge book reader and spend most of my free time reading several books at the same time. One could say that reading is one of my passions, and having wasted so many years after high school completely ignoring this passion (in exchange for spending most of my time trying to learn about <strong>Linux</strong>, get an education, a job and, let's be frank, chasing after girls), I decided that something had to be done about it, and starting around 2008 I 'forced' myself to dedicate at least one solid hour of reading <strong>for fun</strong> every day.</p>
<p>I find it funny to say that I had to <strong>force</strong> myself, but this statement is very much true. Being so used to spending all of my time sitting in front of a computer and getting flooded with information every single minute of the day (IRC, Twitter, Facebook, commit emails, RSS feeds, etc), I found it difficult to 'unplug' and spend time doing nothing but focusing on only one thing. I was so used to multitasking and being constantly bombarded with lots of information that sitting quietly and reading didn't feel very productive to me... sad but true.</p>
<p>Anyhow, after several 'agonizing' months of getting up from my desk and making a point of turning off my cel phone and finding a quiet place somewhere in the building (or at home during the weekends), I finally got into the habit of reading for pleasure. I actually looked forward to these reading periods (imagine that, huh?) and eventually I realized that if I skipped  this 'ritual' even one day, my days felt like they got longer and I felt stressed out and irritable for the remaining of the day. Reading became not only a good habit but my mechanism for relaxing and recharging my energies during the day!</p>
<p>Well, this passion and appetite for reading has only gotten bigger, and with time I have to say that it has become a pretty big part of who I am today! In a way I am happy that it took me this long to get back into the habit of reading... I mean, I feel that getting older was an important part of preparing myself so that I could really appreciate <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=John+Steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Ray+Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> and the likes of them! Would I have truly appreciated <strong>The Grapes of Wrath</strong> when I was younger? Perhaps... but it took me around 40 years to get to it and I'm happy that when it did I was able to appreciate this amazing piece of art!</p>
<p>These last few months I decided that I wanted to start tracking all the books that I read, buy or receive as a gift every month (see my reading progress on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12048315-og-maciel">GoodReads</a> and add me as a friend), and jot down some of my impressions and motives for reading or buying them. Those familiar with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Nick+Hornby">Nick Hornby</a> will probably associate this post (and hopefully others that will surely come) with the work he has done writing for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.believermag.com/">Believer Magazine</a> ... and this would be correct. My intention is not to copy his style or anything like that, but I thought that the format he chose to report on his own reading 'adventures' would fit in quite nicely with what I wanted to get across to my readers... and I'm sticking with the format as long as it works for me :)</p>
